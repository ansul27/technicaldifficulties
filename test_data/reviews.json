    "review": "We paired tonight's meal with only the finest- \"Josh\" brand wine, Betty Crocker red velvet cupcakes, and residual greens from this past April. The order: chicken rice cakes, green beans and pork noodles.We navigated past the $10 surcharge, through doing a free trial of Postmates Premium (Siri- remind me to cancel Postmates Premium trial on November 20). As always, DTF did not disappoint, and between chews pondered if the rice  noodles and rice cakes were really that different. I could have benefited from some chili oil, but the luke warm Siracha in my spice cabinet sufficed as an alright substitute. Bonus high thought: Teleportation is the best super power. We could have used it to pick up the food a lot faster",

We went around 10:30am so no wait and we were able to be seated quickly. The housemade vinegar is always really good with the XLB. We normally get a pork chop fried rice, spicy wontons, and a veggie.",

Din Tai Fung is not only award winning, but has maintained its incredible flavors and quality despite adding many new locations. You are doing yourself a disservice if you come to the Seattle area and don't go to one of their spots (U Village, downtown, Bellevue). If you have 2 people, I recommend the \"must haves\" below. If you have more, consider adding a 2nd order of the Xiao Long Bao, a fried rice, and another veg.A few \"must haves\"- Green Beans- Xiao Long Bao (Soup Dumplings) - what they are known for- Shrimp & Pork Wontons in Spicy Sauce - its not too spicy- Rice CakesOther favorites of ours:- Pork Buns- Chicken Fried Rice- Hot & Sour Soup - very different than other sweet/sour soups I've had- Honey Milk Tea- Red Bean Bun (Dessert)",

    "review": "After several days of heavy creamy chowders, I was craving something lighter and spicier.  I hailed an Uber to go to a Japanese restaurant.  I asked the Uber driver if I was going to a good place, and he said he would drive me to a great place.  He dropped me off in front of the mall that contained Din Tai Fung,  There was a long wait, so I figured lots of people couldn't be wrong.  I signed up for a bar seat after they checked my ID to make sure I was 21 and over.  I said thanks if you don't think I'm 21, haha.  I had the hot and sour soup with pork.  The pork was tender and delicious.  The hot and sour soup could have used more spice and more vinegar.  I added both.I also had the xiao long bao soup dumplings.  Not bad but kind of small.  I'm glad I tried this place and I would definitely go back if it were in New York as well.",

    "review": "Expensive for dim sum, even in the Seattle area, but you're paying for the experience/brand name and not just the food. Honestly I think the food is quite good, but not really any better than you could get at a mom and pop place. The main draw is the Xiao long bao which are good and I suppose a bit more uncommonly served in the US, and that they have a dim sum menu 7 days a week. So if you've never had soup dumplings, haven't been to DTF before, or it's a weekday and you really want dim sum, it's worth a visit. Otherwise, I'd probably go to a normal weekend dim sum place just due to cost reasons.It's also worth noting that this place gets BUSY. If you don't want to wait in line, go at 5 or 5:30pm. Once you hit 6, it's packed. There is a bar so if you're willing to sit there you can be seated faster, but still, plan ahead.",

    "review": "Love, love, loved this dumpling and more house. Great place for our group of vegetarians, pescatarians and omnivores. Thanks to Michelle who accommodated and modified the menu to meet our varied dietary restrictions and preferences. For starters, we had the Hot and Sour soup which was steamy hot and brimming with vegetables. The large bowl was perfect for our party of seven. The cucumber salad was so crisp and refreshing.From there, the food just kept coming and coming...For the buns and dumplings, the vegetarian dumplings were 10 heavenly pieces. The pork XiaoLongBao soup dumplings were delicious according to our dining companions. The chicken and veggies buns were also very good. For noodle and rice dishes, the vegetarian fried noodles and noodles with sesame sauce were delicious. The vegetarian Shanghai rice noodles were okay.     Loved the sautéed string beans. Glad that we got two orders. The sautéed bok choy was another nice addition. The oolong tea and sea salt cream top rounded out our buffet.Fun to watch the cooks make the dumplings and buns while you wait or the pagers reach far enough that we checked out the Tesla dealership while we were waiting. Dinner for seven was under $150 and we even took food to go. Best to go with a group, order several dishes and share because the meals can be easily split.",

If you come here with a larger group or not 21+, expect a long wait on Friday nights. We got the pork and crab xiaolongbao and pork friend rice. Both were absolutely delicious. The dumplings were pricy ($16 for 10) but AMAZING. I've had several dumplings here in the past - those are my favorite. As for atmosphere, I can only speak to the bar. It was loud and busy. Our table was near the bar and people knocked our table a few times walking by. A couple waiters didn't apologize after knocking my table and making all the glass clang... which is why I marked it 4 stars. Other than that - it was great.",

    "review": "Ok ok, I want to take a sec to say thank you to God for blessing me with this life filled with love ones and FOOD!!!! I feel spoiled with all the food I indulge with in my life. This place was delicious! Service was excellent,  I might add. Let's me break it down of what we ordered off the menu. FYI you order like you would at a dim sum restaurant. You just check off what you want off a food SCORE CARD I call it. Kurobuta Pork XioaLongBao dumpling - it was delightful with the hot broth inside the dumplingCrab & Pork XioaLongBao ( blue & snow crab) dumplings - pretty much the same as the first one but with crab in them. Also delightfulChicken fried rice - The color was light, not the same color as a normal fried rice would look but very delicious and flavorfulBraised beef soup - Beef was super tender with Bok Choy. It reminds me of a beef stew but in a Asian fushion type of way. Vegetarian noodle soup - which had mushroom Bok Choy with noodles. Was as little bland but hey what do you expect when it's vegetarian dish. Just add sauce to the broth to make it more flavorful. Vegetable & Kurobuto Pork Wonton with Spicy Sauce - this was prob one of my favorites. It packed so much flavor. It was not that spicy which was good for me. Definitely recommend it. Sweet and Sour Pork Baby Back Ribs - this was another one of my favorite which you must get. Little sweet but not overwhelming. Cucumber salad - This is a must. It reminds me of the kimji cucumber except these ones are a lot thicker. If gives you a nice crunch for texture. Shredded Kurobuto Pork Fried Rice - They make the noodles fresh and from scratch so you already know it's going to be super good. Kids loved it and they are usually little picky about what they easy so that's plus. Sauteed mustard Greens with Shredded Ginger- if you know me I live my Greens and veggies. These was a little different then other veggies you have to have an acquired taste for them.Parking was not super great. We parked up top where the shopping stores was and just walked down. It's located in the UNIVERSITY VILLAGE. Bathroom was very clean. Over all the experience here was more then expected. Go there and enjoy. If Minh says it's good it's good!!! Ha ha.",

We've consistently had amazing food and service here every time we go whether it's for lunch or dinner. Our food is always hot, fresh, and comes out super fast. And even though it comes out fast, we've never felt rushed at all. Our favorites are the Kurobuta Pork XiaoLongBao, Pork Chop Fried Rice, Shrimp and Kurobuta Pork Shao Mai, Spicy Wontons, and Chocolate Mochi XiaoLongBao. You really can't go wrong with anything on the menu though, it's all amazing! While there's not usually a wait for lunch, be prepared to wait for dinner.

The interior had a very dim and mature mood. There was open seating in the bar. The restaurant had dinner style tables but there were also areas that had booths. The vibe was pretty dope and the service was on point. I ordered the house chicken soup and the spicy shrimp/pork wontons. The food was delicious. The soup was nice and spicy and had a good amount of chicken in it. The broth was welled seasoned and the vegetables were still al dente. The wontons are addictive and I had to order a second order of them. One just didn't do it. The wontons might be some of the best wontons I've had so far. They are just levels above.",

    "review": "Awh man!!!! What isn't there to love about freaking Din Tai Fung, well besides the wait to be seated! That I don't love but the wait is absolutely worth it, every time my friends and I go there the service is always on point, our servers are always super nice and they really know how to take care of their customers from refilling our drinks to making sure our food tasted really good! But enough of that! I know everyone reading this will want to hear about the delicious food they have! Who are you if you come here and you don't order their famous soup dumpling Xiao Long Bao?! They have three options you can order from, but the common one is the Kurobuta Pork! But they also have a crab & kurobuta pork or the expensive one truffle. Which will cost you $30 for only 5 pieces. But I always enjoy the original one, but make sure you have some soy sauce/vinegar sauce and a little ginger whenever you eat each one! Some of my other favorite dish that I usually get here with my friends are Sautéed String Beans with Garlic, Sticky Rice & Kurobuta Pork Shao Mai, Pork Chop Fried Rice, Shrimp & Kurobuta Pork Wontons with Spicy Sauce, and the Noodles with Minced Kurobuta Pork Sauce! Yes, most of their dishes have the Kurobuta Pork in it but trust me they are all delicious! In my opinion, my most favorite dish out of everything is the Wontons with spicy Sauce! The wonton is packed with great flavor from the two types of protein that is in the mix and the sauce that is swimming in just makes everything turn into a perfect picture!  Lastly, their menu is pretty big with other stuff that is also gluten free or vegetarian so that those who are any of those two can enjoy a meal too! Overall, I love coming to Din Tai Fung! Never have I went that I had a bad experience! So you know I'll still be coming here over and over! And I think that a brilliant idea that Din Tai Fung should think about it is, they should start a rewards program where customers can gain points each visit and with a total of points they accumulate they can get a dish for free!",

    "review": "Our quoted wait was 45 minutes at 5 PM on a Saturday for party of 4. We got drinks at Rachel's Ginger Beer to help ease the wait, as they'll text you when it's almost your turn. Still, the wait in general is a big enough turn off for me that I'd just come here if someone else wanted to, but personally I'd prefer Dough Zone because the wait I experienced there isn't as crazy, and I like more of their non-XLB options. Hot and Sour Soup $12.50 for large: I feel like I've had more sour taste elsewhere. Not a stand out for me. Kurobuta Pork Xiao Long Bao $13.50 for 10: Dough Zone was $11.25 for 10, so not a huge difference. Both are good, and I feel I need to eat them legit side by side to see which I like better.  Vegetable and Kurobuta Pork Wontons with Spicy Sauce $12: I didn't really like the sauce. I can't put my finger on it, but something about it just tasted weird to me. Shanghai Rice Cakes with Chicken $11.50: I honestly don't remember the chicken, because I feel like I just picked up the rice cakes to dip in vinegar. They had a nice chewy texture. Sautéed Green Beans with Garlic $12: I'm very picky on veggies but this is one I don't mind. It more or less tastes the same to me the times I've ordered in restaurants. Sticky Rice and Kurobuta Pork Shao Mai $13.50 for 10: I really only tasted the sticky rice. It was interesting. I wouldn't really care for this again. Tl;dr If someone wants to eat here, I'll come. I'll just try to get 2 orders of XLB to myself. *****My Star Ratings: 1 Star - Terrible. Just thinking about it makes me angry. 2 Stars - Meh. Unlikely for me to return. 3 Stars - OK. Open to coming back, but wouldn't go out of my way to. 4 Stars - Yummy! Will definitely return if I haven't already. 5 Stars - AMAZING!!! Would plan my day or even a trip around eating here.",

Overall we enjoyed the service and the atmosphere :) We ordered the Pizza Alla Vodka (which was only $2 slice for pizza week) and the cheesy garlic bread. For the $2 the slice of Pizza Alla Vodka was wonderful. The crust was nice & thin. But my favorite part was the sauce which was ample on each slice. I can't say I \"know good pizza\" but I do know that I enjoyed it myself. The cheesy bread was as stated, garlic bread with a lot of cheese on top. I wouldn't get it again just because it's $10 for cheesy bread but that's also just me. I'll definitely be here again to check out their other pizzas.",

The crust really was a great texture and worked great with the amount of sauce on the pizza. My pizza a la vodka was great - a little salty for my personal taste but was a steal for 2 bucks a slice during pizza week. It was a great eat during a crazy hawks/49ers game going on.

    "review": "Korean comfort food in a trendy cafe. The atmosphere is really nice and bright and there will most likely be students eating/studying. This place offers free WiFi. As for the bowls, each comes with rice and side salad (super filling and tasty). I ordered the Mapo tofu bowl and the meat/tofu sauce was the star of the show. It was definitely flavorful and came with a sliced hard boiled egg. The bowls were reasonably portioned // look great in photos and definitely insta-worthy.The food is on the pricier side (I paid $14 + tip for my dish) and my friend ordered a matcha latte that was kinda mediocre. I'd try the other drinks next time. I would definitely come here again!!!",

    "review": "Overall, I gave this place 4.5 stars because the food was good and unique, and their customer service was top notch! Kailey is the best! And I will be going back to Bugis!ATMOSPHEREThe place is really big with adequate seating. It looks kind of small from the outside but I was shocked by how big it actually was! The tables were spaced out nicely so that you don't feel crammed like a can of sardines. My favorite aspect of this location are the big windows. If you read my reviews, I always rave about places having natural light. It's also very clean!WHAT DID WE TRY?We had their seafood okonomiyaki. Going in, I had pretty high expectations because I've had homemade okonmiyaki while visiting Asia. This place was pretty good though! I really liked the crunchiness of the outside while keeping the inside soft and moist. There was a proportionate amount of sauce that did not overpower the main dish which I appreciated! The dish itself was pretty heavy so if you order it, I would order something light and acidic to balance out the dish. We also tried their spicy mayo tofu bowl. The bowl came with fresh greens, corn, rice, fried tofu marinated in a spicy sauce, pickled veggies, and a boiled egg. Personally, I found the dish pretty spicy despite having a pretty high spice tolerance. Thank goodness there were other aspects of the bowl that were able to balance out the spicy tofu. A couple things that I noticed were that the coating for the tofu was pretty thick which left the inside of the tofu pretty dense. I personally like tofu to be a little fluffier when it's fried. However this was not a super big deal because it was still delicious. Another thing was that the rice got kind of soggy due to the sauce. Overall, I would still order this bowl again because the sauce was something I found really unique. I can't really describe the tase but it left a good and lasting impression on me. If you guys do visit Bugis, definitely try their tofu bowl CUSTOMER SERVICEGoing to a lot of places that have self-bust, I always find the customer service average. Bugis is not one of these average places. I was pleasantly surprised that the girl at the cash register (Kailey) actually walked around asking customers how their food was/making small talk. She was so kind and made our experience 100x better. In fact, I was going to give this place 3.5 stars, but then she came around and it made me feel so welcomed and appreciated that I just had to give this place a whole extra star. I weigh customer service heavier when the food is good. In the end, my friend and I actually ended up befriending her. So no only did we get great food but we made a new friend!",

    "review": "New Korean/Asian Fusion restaurant that's sure to be a crowd-pleaser.Food: 5/5Great comfort food, served in generous portions. This would be a good place to ease a less-adventurous eater into Korean food. With Korean Army soup (a classic Korean favorite), chicken and waffles, and pork belly bowls, there's something for everyone. I got the carbonara tteokbokki, and it was great-- creamy, very garlicky, and quite filling (I ended up splitting it between two meals).Price: 4/5Prices are a bit high (dishes are around $10-15), but they are pretty filling and give ample portions. Think about it as if you're paying for a tasty meal *and* a nice restaurant atmosphere. Service: 4/5Food was delivered in a timely manner, and you bus your own table. Pretty standard: nothing to complain about, but nothing that makes it particularly stand out (which is fine, I'm here for a meal, not over-the-top service).One thing to note: they seem to run out of certain menu options by the end of the day, so if there's something in particular you really want to try, maybe go during lunchtime?Atmosphere: 5/5This place's aesthetic, modern decor is sure to catch the eye of any college student. String lights, Instagram-poised food plating, and plant decor. Has the vibes of a cute, bustling cafe, and it's a great place to come with friends.",

Complimentary green tea is also provided.I've uploaded a picture of their current menu where the crossed out items are no longer sold because they were seasonal. -----Rosé Cheese Katsu: pork katsu stuffed with cheese and topped with rosé sauce. Comes with spicy sausage, creamed corn, kimchi, pickled daikon, pickled onion, greens with additional dressing on the side, boiled egg, and rice underneath ($13.99).I can see why this dish is popular. The katsu and the accompanying sauce was so good! I was pleased that the katsu was stuffed cheese instead of replacing the inside meat like I have experienced elsewhere. Then the rosé sauce is a creamy tomato sauce, which is named after the color of rosé wine. Toppings were delicious as well. The portion is an ample size for a meal and I left stuffed.-----Not many people were there when I arrived at noon, but don't be surprised if any of the items are out. I was told the business had to close early last night because everything was out of stock!",

    "review": "Finally got to try Bugis with a friend after hearing so much about it. I really liked the food here and it's definitely different than the traditional Korean food around the University District.Food: We got the Army pot and a rice cake dish. The Army pot consisted  of a beef, ramen, fish cakes, and tofu with a slab of cheese on top. The broth was really flavorful and I would see it as not too spicy and not too bland. The cheese added a flavor profile that was very different than traditional pots of meat and veggies. The tteokbokki also tasted really good. The rice cake were a nice consistency and I liked the fish cakes mixed with the spicy sauce. Service and Ambiance: Very chill service where you order in the front and bus your own table. You get everything yourself and bus it when you are done. The ambiance of Bugis was nice and made me feel comfortable. Price: A little more expensive than other Korean food but pretty reasonable. We ended up spending $27 for two people.Overall, I would come back. I thought the food and portion size was good and I like the ambiance. Bugis is slightly more expensive than other Korean restaurants but offers a pretty different experience. I would come back with friends",

Most of their items had pork in it, which I can't eat, but the servers were extremely accommodating for me and offered to remove bacon from the dishes. They were even patient with me as I went back and forth on my drink order, as per my usual indecisive self. The chicken and waffle was extremely filling, but I wish there was a way to prevent the beautifully fluffy bubble waffle from getting soggy under that chicken. The yuzu drink I had was absolutely divine. Totally worth changing my drink order three times for. They must have muddled the yuzu peel with sugar, because the marmaladey bits that came up through my straw weren't at all bitter! Beautifully aesthetic little cafe... I'll definitely be back to try the desserts!",

Not only is this place very aesthetically pleasing and clean on the inside, but they have great Korean fusion dishes, which is I haven't seen any other restaurant have on the Ave. The prices are also reasonable for what you get, which is definitely a plus for university students on a budget. Bugis has very interesting dishes (like Rosé Cheese Katsu), though I chose to go the safe route and got a spicy chicken bowl. They also serve delicious drinks such as lavender and red bean lattes. Overall the atmosphere is cozy, and I was pleased with my dish! The bowl had a good variety of ingredients so you don't get too bored with just rice and protein. There's a side of salad, a hard boiled egg, pickled veggies, kimchi, egg, corn, and coleslaw. The meat itself was spicy, saucy, sweet, and full of flavor. I was surprised that the ingredients went so well with each other! The staff was also really helpful and attentive, though this restaurant is bus-your-own table style.",

They were both delicate and had a good light flavor. The kimchi was a bit sour for my taste, and the salad was a good contrast to the meat. I ate the salad first, though, since I didn't want to mix it in with my meat and rice. The pork was well-cooked and had a good balance of savory, sweet, and spicy. The rice soaked up the sauce really nicely and the mix of the two was really cohesive and the flavors were throughout the bowl.Overall one of the nicer places to eat on the Ave. The ambience is nice and relaxing, and they just happened to be airing the k-drama I was watching at the time, which I thought was cool :) Will definitely eat here more often!",

Lattes, unique lemonades, smoothies, bubble waffles, and a fried chicken waffle with guacamole. Rice bowls with Asian-style meats, \"Army Pot,\" ttokbokki, and rice porridge/congee. \"Okonomiyaki\" that I suspect may be more like a Korean pajeon pancake. Some new menu items with \"rosé\" sauce (as in, the wine).The presentation of my iced lavender latte was very nice, though including the actual lavender flowers is more pretty than practical (because you end up eating them). My pork belly bowl ended up being half pork belly and half pork shoulder (a new \"special\" they're trying out). The size was decent and I liked that it also came with assorted kimchi, corn mayo, pickled onion and radish, egg, and salad in it. The sauce was sort of like a mix between gochujang and sweet chili.Environment:The restaurant looks like bright and cute dessert cafe. There is even one table with a pink umbrella over it. The music is light pop/today's hits (and also Christmas music, kind of random for August) and the overall volume is good for conversations.Price: Food & drinks are a little pricey -- the pork belly bowl and one drink cost more than $20.",

Read on.Holy wow this place is unlike anything I've ever seen or expected in the U-District. It's CUTE and CLEAN and well lit and laid out and the food is iNcReDiBlE. A yelper's dream. That run on sentence parallels my delighted stream of consciousness when I walked in the door. There was a brick wall on my left (yum), a long high table and then two steps up to my right was a room of white tile, booths and low tables. The staff in front of me were both looking classy and welcoming in white T-shirts and black aprons (I learned after commenting that the matching T-shirts were a coincidence that day which made me love it even more). Check out the last menu photo someone posted, the one without handwriting on it. That's their current menu as of 9/2019. They also have a daily special that changes. My buddy and I went for the hot spicy pork bowl and the mapo shrimp bowl. We paid about $13 each after tax and struggled to finish the amount of food we got even though it was sooooo good. The best part of both dishes by far was the sauce, perfectly thick and spiced (between a 2&3 on a 1-5 scale). But they nailed details like quantity of meat, ratio of meat, sauce and rice as well. The greens, egg and pickled veggies give you nice options to mix in or take a break from the main dish underneath.I can't think of anything I would change except the music. They were playing something adjacent to Carly Rae Jepsen radio, but who am I to say what college kids are into these days. There were a few posted up on their laptops who didn't seem bothered.My days of avoiding the UD around mealtime are finally over. I'll definitely be back to try their waffles and drinks.",

This place is really pretty, decorations are fun and classy, staffs are nice and they will bring you the food, but mostly self serve (water, utensils, sauce and others). I personally think Food is okay, but not super great or overwhelming. I ordered seafood pancake, Army pot, and fried chicken for 3 people, everything it has a right amount of portion. It does have reasonable amount of seafood in the Seafood pancake and it's crispy, but it has too much mayo. The army pot is not like the ones in korean restaurant, they have a lot bean sprouts in it, which I personally don't like but its only because I don't like bean sprouts, and beef are too chewy and not too good, in the pot there's noodles, cheese, kimchi, veggies, bean sprouts, rice cake... and you get a bowl of rice. I love the soup and it's not too spicy. For the fried chicken, it is crispy, the sauce is sweet and a little hint of spicy, chicken is tendered and juicy, and fries are freshly made!

When we got in, the hostess was super nice and seated us within a few minutes.Our server (I wish I remembered his name) was very friendly and answered any questions we had. He helped choose an awesome red wine that paired well with the pork chop dish. The cocktail he made for my husband was also delicious (it had basil in it), and I'm not typically a cocktail person!Now the food. We ordered the calamari appetizer and it did not disappoint. To our surprise, it was spicy; but the heat was just right. What we like was that we could tell it was fresh and it wasn't so heavily breaded. In a lot of restaurants, often their calamari is breaded, greasy and you can tell it's frozen. The pork chop was just pure perfection! The chop was cooked so well - tender and juicy; and I was so in love with the Marsala sauce. My mouth is watering as I'm writing this, lol. Compliments to their chef who create that delicious sauce. My husband ordered the salmon and he too was happy with his dish.For dessert, we ordered the bread pudding and the chocolate chip cooking with ice cream. Now, while the cookie was good; I really enjoyed the bread pudding! It's funny, my husband and I were visiting NOLA a few months ago, and bread pudding is pretty much s staple there. We ate so much of it and I had doubts SWeL's would come close to being as good. A lot of people may disagree with me, but the bread pudding at SWeL's was the best bread pudding I've ever had! The bread was tasty and not soggy like at some places; and I thought the pears really balanced the dish out.Overall, we were very happy with the food and service. We've lived in Fremont for 3 years now and we regret that we've only been to SWeL once! We can't wait to go back!",

The service was excellent and prompt, the food was delicious, and the atmosphere was nice and relaxed--great for the middle of a workday. My only complaint is the portioning. The dips don't come with enough items to actually dip. And some of our portions were hearty, while others were almost small plates. So, it's a bit hard to gauge how much food you'll be getting. We actually ended up ordering a second round. Other than that, it makes for a great visit in Fremont.",

I got the pepperoni pizza and my friend got the Italian sausage. We both had a few glasses of wine (hey, what's pizza without wine, am I right?) and split the flourless mousse at the end. The food was really excellent - the pizza was cooked perfectly with a thin crispy crust with just enough sauce and toppings to leave us satisfied but not overly full! The mousse was smooth and rich but also surprisingly light.The space inside is super cute. Other reviews mentioned it was too dark but I thought the ambience was good and it's beautifully decorated.

    "review": "Excellent service, food, and ambience.  We came for the pizza on a recommendation.  While it's not the best pizza around, it was a solid recommendation. We ordered the bay scallop share plate, the Caesar salad, and the pepperoni pizza. Scallops - this was recommended by the waiter. I had already decided I \"wanted\" it before the recommendation, but his description sealed the deal for both of us. It was more of a roux-based macncheese/pot pie mess of scallops and burnt cheese that you spread on, or eat with, fresh bakery bread. This dish was AWESOME! Hint of lime for some reason. Why did they do that? SO glad they did that. Great call. Super unique, fun, and delicious. Salad - I'd say it was a little wet for our tastes, but the dressing was light and delicious, so no complaints. Standard Caesar, nothing super special but nothing wrong. Nice crispity croutons, fresh firm Romaine, and plenty of yummy salty cheese. Pizza - loved the small pepperoni and long crispy cook on them.  Fresh mozzarella can be a good and bad thing. It's delicious, but often means much cheese-neglect on significant crust space. This was thankfully mitigated with a small amount of extra cheese spread evenly across the pie. It was difficult to tell if I liked the sauce, because there was not enough present to offend or please. A couple of Marzano bites pleasantly surprised but were just that, a bite of a stewed tomato piece. A little disappointed in the sauce. The crust, while not my usual first choice for a style (medium thick, not Neapolitan, not pan, not even hand-tossed really) stretches to fit a rectangular woodblock, was GREAT!!  I though it might be too thin to be thick, light, and airy, but too thick to be considerate of the toppings and chew. Instead, it chewed like a pastry, melting in my mouth as the cheese and pepperoni mixed with it in one buttery ball of deliciously chewy pizza mouth bite. We recommend SWeL. And we recommend trying things you may not normally try (in general, but here specifically this time).",

    "review": "My first night in Fremont I wasn't sure where to go. The menu for this place wasn't too compelling but the high Yelp rating encouraged me to try it out. And I'm so glad I did! The dining room was a little dark for my preference but I did create a somewhat romantic atmosphere. Since I was dining solo I decided to sit at the bar. The bartender was very friendly and attentive. I was somewhat impressed with the kinda of wines they have available and based on yelp menu photos it seems as though they change their selection from time to time. I had the Domaine Daulny Sancerre and it was excellent. I had never actually tried a Sancerre before and was very pleased. The finish so elegantly lifted off the palate and I fell in love. I wanted to try the scallops appetizer but unfortunately they were out of it. I was disappointed and starting to regret my decision to come. I instead ordered the pear and gargonzola pizza. OMG. It was fantastic. Though the portion size was quite small the flavor made up for it BIG TIME (and also left me room for a post dinner ice cream- I'm not complaining). The pears in the pizza, which I expected to be crunchy, were melt-in-your-mouth soft. The cheese was present, adding flavor but not detectable as distinct bites of cheese. It was the perfect flavor complement. There was also butter or something mixed in there making some bites oh so elegant. My mouth exploded of happiness. This was potentially the best pizza I've ever had in my life. The amount of food you get for the price is a little lacking but the flavor certainly makes up for it. I wish I had more time in the area so I could go back and try some of their other pizzas and dishes. 5 stars well deserved.",

It was fun how they pour it for you (: The sushi itself was pretty good coming from someone who's a bit of a sushi snob. I'd rate the tuna an 8.9/10 for freshness (my favorite, 10 being fresh sushi from an upscale restaurant in japan) the rolls we had were spectacular! They definitely were different than others rolls Iv ever had and it had more flavor, but not too much to the point of feeling too salty. The waiter also showed us our electronic bill and even made a point to make sure our order was correct which was nice.

    "review": "I have waited years for Bamboo Sushi to come up to Seattle. Ever since moving up from Portland, that's one of the very restaurants I also go to when I'm back in town. When the sign went up and news spread that this place was opening up in my city, we immediately made reservations about a month in advance in great anticipation. By far, Bamboo Sushi is some of the best sushi between the two cities. I have gone to every location in Portland numerous times and have always enjoyed my time there.Unfortunately, Bamboo Sushi - Seattle, you have truly let us down. The first thing that set the tone of our evening the wrong way was when we came about 10 min before our reservation and saw many empty tables. Yet we still had to wait until exactly our reservation time to get seated. While the hostess said asked us to wait a few minutes for them to set the table, it seemed to take much longer than what was said.Second strike happened when my plate was dirtied by some old food scraps and my glass was stained all around. My whole dining set just didn't look clean, but all the other plates and glasses were fine. They immediately replaced everything (saved yourselves there).Third strike was when our first waiter (yes there was a waiter switch with no warning) brought us the edamame for the table but the edamame appeared to be 3/4 already eaten. Usually, the box is a bit overflowing with fresh, bright green edamame. Our box tonight had maybe 8 small-medium pieces total with a few brown spots here and there...and not a bright green color.Fourth strike took place when our cauliflower appetizer came out after 2 of our main dishes came out ahead of it. Thank goodness we were getting food coming to our table, but the timing just seemed off. And not to mention, the description mentions a black bean sauce. This dish reminded me of some frozen fake chicken bbq tenders. No hint of the black bean. Flavor was not doing it for us. Texture was off. Definitely not what we expected from the order.Fifth strike was when it took a little over an hour for our green machine w/ albacore to come out. Even though, we saw a table that got seated way after us get a green machine with albacore as a \"surprise\" roll for being first timers. We literally waited an hour after they got that roll for us to get ours. And what's even worse is when we did, my friend took a bite of one piece and immediately told me not to eat it. She's had this dish MANY times in the Portland locations, and this was a taste/texture moment that could not be erased. She said it was like eating into a mealy apple. And when you touched the roll, your whole finger or chopstick just sank in. We asked to take the roll back and the sushi chef told a waiter to insist that this is how the roll has always been made (as she's been at the Portland locations). In fact, when they came back to tell us the roll was indeed fine, it almost felt that we were getting blamed for not liking the roll as they insisted that this was how it's always been made. Honestly, it felt like they mashed up day old tuna and scraped it up to put it on our roll. Not appetizing, and definitely not how it's prepared in their Portland locations. The staff said that they would bring us a regular green machine instead.30 minutes later....and the manager coming to apologize on the wait and saying this roll was on the house, we finally got the last roll. It was unfortunate that they ended up charging us for the roll even though we were told otherwise. Sixth strike?Seventh strike was when our waiter gave us our receipt and the green machine w/ albacore was charged not only once but twice. Remember, this was the roll that was taken back immediately. And when we mentioned it to the waiter, he came back and the receipt had the roll taken off but the reason was \"wait too long\". Definitely not the case. We were just charged extra for a roll that we never ordered (and even took back the roll we got).Eighth strike combines them not having the soy sauce on the tables, not refilling our waters, and constantly coming over to apologize for wait time.",

SRW menu:Nigiri roll - I'm not a conousseur of nigiri so I thought it was ok, nothing special. The size was reasonable though.Kimono roll - this was interesting as it had shredded apples on top which made the roll more refreshing and interesting.Crispy cauliflower - probably my favorite out of the 3.

We had the restaurant week menu, 6 pieces of nigiri each, the kimono roll, chasing the dragon roll, cauliflower, and panna cotta. We ordered a pork belly steamed bun and uni as extras on top. We tried to order the chicken kaarage, waiting for it to arrive, but it never came, our waiter forgot to tell us they had run out only 1 hour into opening, and forgot to remove it from our bill. The nigiri and cauliflower were great! I loooved the crispy cauliflower. The sea bass and uni were the best nigiri items we ordered. The rolls weren't anything special. The bun was nice and the pork was tender and juicy but slightly on the salty side. The panna cotta also was very soupy. It seemed like the gelatin was forgotten or it just wasn't set at all. If I were to return I think I know now to stick to the nigiri for sushi and the cauliflower and steamed bun from the kitchen. For $100 for two people for dinner, I might choose another sushi place next time.",

In Portland, the locations are all different, from fancy to not so much. This one is nice, fancy and a totally different feel from the Bamboo vibe we are used to. Not saying this is bad, it's just a different version. Service was a little scattered (opening night) but overall super friendly and attentive. We ordered mainly off the happy hour menu and still managed to spend as much as if we hadn't, it was good though. Got the chef hand rolls (neggi toro with green onion- our favorite, crisp Nori, soft tuna, they don't skimp), the sunset roll (it was a little too heavy handed with the Sriracha for me), Friday the 13th roll (also too heavy handed with the sriracha), green machine roll (super good, fresh, crispy, smooth, sweet, different), the nigiri plate (4 pieces- fresh and really enjoyable) and by accident the cauliflower (sort of tossed in a buffalo sauce, topped with chopped cashews and it was good).

There is only a three person bench in the waiting area which is not accessible to anyone, especially those with back injuries, such as myself. We were seated after about ten minutes of waiting for our reserved table (at the sushi bar). We waited an additional 20 minutes for our order to be taken, and even to be given water.The food was good, we ordered the albacore tuna nigiri, which was incredible dry, since it was seared, and would have been much better with a reduction of some sort. After the first dish arrived and left, we received our cocktails, which seemed to be a much more conservative portion for the price. I had a watered down old fashioned with a Japanese twist of sake, and my partner had about half of a standard glass of Chardonnay. We were not impressed with the cocktails by any means. What was intended as our appetizer cake out next, the tempura vegetables, which were as good as any other sushi restaurant in Seattle. We ended with an unconventional sushi roll named the \"Kimono\". It was superb. A rich combination of crab, apple, and (small portioned) salmon on top mixed well. All in all, the experience was sunken due to the lack of experienced wait staff. Our server admitted to us that this was his first time in a serving capacity, which is concerning to hear while eating. I also felt pressured to tip for a mediocre job, as he literally stood next to me watching the portable register. I can easily say this was a disappointment to what I would normally call an upscale backyard sushi restaurant in an up and coming area. We will need to see improvements to return.",

I had just visited the Portland location and was thrilled to have it as an option to dine at in Seattle. It was definitely different but still had the same great values in place. Overall, our experience with the food was great, but service was a bit clunky. We both ordered a citrus cocktail that came promptly and was delicious. We ordered three rolls: friday the thirteenth, a green roll and the little island. All were fresh, sizable and had a lot of great flavor. Our shortfalls came from the introductory hosting stand, where we were immediately asked for our first name, last name and phone number without real context. We assumed this meant a wait and inquired timing. But actually these inquiries were just to get our information into their system and there was no wait. Seems strange to ask folks for their information for these purposes without consent till after the fact?When inquiring about the absent soy sauce at our table we were informed to reduce waste, they would have someone pour till you say when method. This seemed relatively reasonable/a bit odd but obviously we would go with it. When the person came, we were immediately shamed for not saying that's enough after approximately two seconds for the teeniest puddle of sauce on a very pretty but empty dish. With secondary comments \"oh WOW you sure need a lot\" I honestly requested far less than I typically pour for myself and felt embarrassed to ask for more after running out approximately three pieces deep into our dinner. Please note this behavior was from one server, and our primary server was incredible!So while we would definitely come back, I think we will be mindful of who to ask for sauce!",

He got his first paycheck tonight. They pay him $14 dollars each hour and  $199.48 tips for a total of 42.8 hours ( one week). ( The agreement is $20 dollars each hour plus tips). ( They also said the tips usually are $70 to $100 each day, depend on how busy. If he is willing to work on the weekend will be more.) He worked Mon. Wed. Fri. and Sat. I believed all the customer can see how busy they are. My husband went to asked, they said the paycheck was wrong. He asked how much it should be, they said will tall him after closing. My husband insisted to get an answer imminently. Finally, they said it will be $18 each hour, including tips that will be $24 each hour. My husband asked why it is different from what you guys said when I took the interview. They said because he didn't do it well. If he will do it well he will get $20 each hour in further. 1. This is the first time an employer said he wasn't doing well for his job in decads include ALL these years in the U.S.2. If he doesn't do well they can cut his hours or fired him. but, instead, they choose to cheat on him. We have been in this country for years. this is the first time we meet this kind of situation. Even when the time we were brand new here, our language was much poorer than now and he worked in some small restaurants. but nobody ever cheated on the paycheck. My husband left that horrible place immediately. ( of course, they want him to stay.) although we are new immigrants, we don't have good language but it doesn't mean we can be bully. oppositely,we desired to be treated fairly, that is why we are here.I hope not only the customers but also the people might interesting to work there will read all these.",

It took a bit of time to be brought waters and menus but no big deal. Between the two of us, we got two 6 piece nigiri sets, a Green Machine roll, a Kimono roll, veggie tempura, and panna cotta for dessert. It was all so tasty. The warmth of the tempura inside the Green Machine and the avocado outside really melded together well. The Kimono is a bit tart from the pickled apple so be warned about that. The stand out from the nigiri is the yuzu flavored kanpachi for me. So light, bright, and flavorful. And the dessert was amazing with three different textures and the right amount of sweet in the cream to balance the bitter from the crunchy chocolate. Please consider putting it on the regular menu! Ok, I'm gonna roll my full belly over to sleep...",

It took them about 5 or so minutes to seat us (annoying at first because every table was open) but we tried to ignore the wait as they are a new restaurant still figuring things out. Once seated a waiter attended us promptly and gave us some background about the restaurant and it's eco friendly nature. After, we ordered our food. In total we ordered three dishes that all came out relatively quickly. First was the Southwest Philly Roll from the happy hour menu. The roll was fried perfectly and had a very different type of batter that made the roll stand out compared to other fried sushi rolls. Next was the 4 piece nigiri set with tuna, king salmon, snapper, and albacore. All of the nigiri tasted fresh and melted in the mouth. Finally came the bento box which was delicious as well. The highlight of the bento was the \"Green Machine\" roll, something they are famous for. This truly unique roll looked and tasted great. Overall it was a good sushi experience for a sushi lover looking for something new. With improvements to service my rating could be changed as well. Also would highly recommend you go during happy hour (4:30-6:00) as it is a bit pricy.",

Made a reservation for SRW and was severely disappointed.Let me start out by saying the food was mostly great. The nigiri was spectacular, the kimono roll was interesting, and the cauliflower was very craveable. My friends who ordered the dragon roll and tempura were very disappointed tho. I should also mention their house spicy mayo is ridiculously delicious on EVERYTHING.What was missing was the service. Our server was extremely awkward and completely incompetent. Our orders were taken at different times. Courses came out in random orders and nothing came at the same time for my friends and I. Whenever we asked questions about the menu, the server gave sparse and weak responses. The sushi chef couldn't even answer simple questions about the nigiri and rolls. Not to mention the server stood over us awkwardly as we were paying the bill, I gave him a standard tip out of pure PITY & AWKWARDNESS. He also proceeded to bus our table as we were about to leave which was also immensely awkward. Overall, food was good and that was about it. This place might be the next Joey's because clearly nobody knows what they are doing. I'd stick to Bamboo in Portland. I might come back after a few months and give them another chance, but in the meantime, go elsewhere for sushi.",

You can order by the different sizes (S, M, L, and XL). I forget how much is in each, but our initial thought was that if you ordered the large or xtra-large, that you would be able to choose a few different flavors. However, the server told us that you can't. This was kind of a bummer lol. Considering it was our first time, it would've been nice to try out a bunch of different flavors without having to buy 60+ wings. My favorites were probably the soy/garlic and snow wings. They were in the process of renewing their liquor license, so alcohol was not available. I would recommend coming here if you have the time.

    "review": "Really crispy chicken, but somewhat dry and basic. I ordered Chi Mac for delivery through Caviar, and the food was decent. I ordered a medium sized Snow wings, and a small sized Sichuan Pepper wings. The snow wings were okay. I decided to order the medium size since all of my friends rave about them, and I can see that they're a fan favorite here on Yelp. Personally, I wasn't a huge fan of them. The seasoning was way too over powering, and I can't imagine if they were dusted as much as shown in their product image. The wings had a really nice crisp to them which I enjoyed, but a majority of them were really dry on the inside. After 3-4 wings, I got tired of the flavor. You can recreate these wings at home yourself. Just fry up some wings, and douse them with garlic and onion powder (which is what their Snow wings are dusted in). I don't know why everybody raves about these wings. They're way too onion-y in my opinion. Maybe if they cut down on the seasoning, it would be a bit more bearable. The Sichuan Pepper wings are phenomenal though! I regretted ordering the Snow in a size medium, and the Sichuan Pepper in a small. The Sichuan Pepper wings had more going for them flavor wise. You can taste a whole bunch of Chinese spices, and the taste wasn't over powering like the Snow wings. I wanted to try their fried rice, but I couldn't justify paying $11 for a boat sized portion of fried rice. You can get an entree portion of fried rice for that price at plenty of other Asian restaurants in the surrounding area. When my order arrived, they didn't close the takeout box all of the way so that the wings didn't get soggy during delivery. I really appreciated it, and I thought that it was an extremely smart idea. For some reason, they only have the Korean wings, Snow wings, Pride Chicken, Fried Rice, and Fries available for order on Caviar. I wish they had their entire menu listed to order, but I wouldn't mind popping into the establishment sometime. Overall, I wish that I could give this place 4-5 stars. I paid $24.22 not including Caviar's service fee, and delivery tip. $24 for wings that are dry is just unfortunate. Since this place has rave reviews, I'll just take it as an off day and give them another chance in the future. The Sichuan Pepper wings is the reason why this place is getting 3 stars. A must try!",

Naked wings was the surprise, it was sweet?? I didn't enjoy that at all.....The fried rice was extremely buttery..: as in drenched and sitting in a pool of butter. Which was kind of an overkill. Too greasy for fried rice! Also seemed like it had lots of sugar in it, too sweet! It has Chinese sausage in it and should've tasted AMAZING, but they ruined it with super sweetness and 10 sticks of butter. I won't come back, but my boyfriend would. He likes things sweet.

Food: The chicken here come out extremely hot and flavorful. When you bite into the chicken, you can still see the moisture and steam coming from the chicken wing itself. They have several different flavors with snow wings being a must try. Their corn cheese is also a must try, but I do have a weakness from corn covered in cheese. One of my favorite things to order here is actually the pride chicken. The pride chicken is an entire chicken cut up into large pieces with an entire pride chicken consisting of about 8 pieces. The pride chicken packs a lot of flavor for a good price and you're able to buy additional dipping flavoring that traditionally comes on the wing. The breading on the pride chicken is really crispy and the chicken is fried very well.Service: Their service is what knocks it down for me. At times, you can go in and get a meal in a fair amount of times, but sometimes it can take forever to get your wings. When they're busy, the wait is pretty long just to order and even longer for the wings to come out.Overall, I would recommend this place. Really like the chicken and their chicken wings.

Couldn't find anywhere close so ended up just parking at a lot a few blocks down. When we first got they disclaimed us that they were not serving alcohol but that was okay! Doesn't look like they clean the table right after the people leave or if they were just busy because when we were seated they had to wipe down the table first. The menu is pretty limited only having chicken, drinks, fries and cheese corn. My mom and I both ordered the small 7 pc Soy Garlic Wings ($9/ each), the Corn Cheese ($11), and the French Fries ($5). When I checked in on Yelp I got a free soda! They served us our waters too but I disliked that the water was warm temperature and there was no ice. My mom got a Sprite and I got a Coke but they were not cold either. They just served us the canned soda too. Not even with an extra cup. The place itself was pretty warm and I don't think their AC was on or working. So when we got our food it was pretty hard to digest with warm water and soda. I don't know if no ice in cups is a Washington thing? But the food itself was pretty good! The French Fries and the Corn Cheese came in huge portions! Me and my mom couldn't finish by ourselves. Definitely recommend 3-4 for those! The sauce on the wings was just the right amount! The chicken wasn't too soft or hard! Although I felt like they were on the smaller side. They served everything on paper so no plates so I guess that's easier for them to clean. The bathroom was pretty nice. I wasn't expecting that either. Two bathroom stalls. Service was not too bad.

Besides the beer and small finger foods, they also specialize in a variety of different flavored wings. such as the Korean (gochujang), Soy Garlic, Snow (parmesan & onion powder) & Sichuan Pepper wings. My favorite is the Korean which is spicy/sweet and the Soy Garlic which is sweet/savory since the flavors greatly contrast one another. Sichuan is also very uncommon, but I like how I get more of the flavor instead of the numbing feeling. Don't get discouraged by the price because these are not your average wings.

My friends split an order of 75 naked wings though. The Korean Wings are marinated in spicy red Korean chili sauce. Koreans like their foods fiery hot, and this dish is no exception. The Korean wings are definitely hot and spicy and are not for the weak-hearted. However, they are super crispy, sweet, and sticky- the stuff that makes wings so good and addicting. I haven't tried the other flavors yet, but my friends tend to like either the snow wings or the naked wings with an assortment of sauces. Yes, I ordered cheese corn ($11) both times here. I can't say it's the best thing I've ever eaten in my life, but it is a good palette cleanser. The corn is really sweet, but corn is basically just sugar so that's to be expected. I wish that they put more melted cheese/sauce on it. I feel like the ratio could be better because I end up eating just plain baked corn half way through.The fried rice was decent, but overpriced for $11. It had egg, cherry tomatoes, chinese sausage, and scallions. It was crispy and had a strong sesame oil taste. I probably wouldn't order it again, but it's a good option if you want something other than wings.This probably goes without saying, but this is not the place you go on a first date on. I can assure you that red sauce will get everywhere no matter how hard you try. Eat them when you're hanging with your buddies because there's no way to attractively eat wings. Also, they tend to blast the music so it can be pretty hard to carry on a conversation.I would give this place 4/5 stars, but service both times has been extremely slow. Today, I waited half an hour for a table and about another half an hour for my corn cheese. They also forgot about my fried rice, so I just asked the waiter to get it to-go. They usually only have two waiters/cashiers and it looks like one or two cooks in the back. Additionally, they still have yet to renew their liquor license, so it's really just chi (chicken) without mac (beer). However, this place is always packed to the max, so I guess people think the food really outweighs the service. Personally, I'll only come here if my friends want to go, but it's not someplace I would come regularly.",

I love chinese sausages because of the chewiness and the hint of sweetness they have to it. Other than that, the fried rice was pretty boring, nothing too special about it.

We got the spicy tingly beef hand ripped noodles, the lamb cumin hand ripped noodles, and the wontons. Each noodle dish was ~$10 and the wontons was $7. It was an enormous amount of food and we each left with a to-go box with a snack portion of noodles left each. The noodles are so chewy and bouncy and perfect - the sauce was bold and the meat was tender and cooked perfectly and yet the noodles were the star ingredient of the dish. I'd honestly eat them plain. That's how good they are. Note that we came in November, and it was still super stuffy and hot inside. So I can't imagine what it'd be like in the summer.",

(Also my husband's which surprised me) Please open a storefront in the Eastside!!!You have to go to the counter to order first and they give you a number. They will deliver to your table and they're quite fast. Limited menu with a refrigerated area for self-service. I always order the spicy tingly beef hand ripped noodles. It's got a good spice level, and I just can't stop eating it once I start. Good value for the price. My only complaint is that it could be cleaner looking, but I've never gotten sick eating here before.",

    "review": "I have been hearing a lot of great things about Xi'an Noodles so I finally decided to make the trip out there and grab lunch.  I came around 1pm on a Saturday with my bf and it was still quite busy. It's like this restaurant is never empty and there's a constant rotation of people coming in and leaving - which is great for business but is it worth the type?  Parking was easy to find in the middle of the day, plus the farmer's market was going on until 2pm down the street which was cute to walk off the carbs afterwards.When you first walk in, don't expect to be served right away - there's literally a sign that says you have to order at the front; grab a menu and help yourself to a seat.  Since we've never been here before, my bf and I ordered their garlic cucumbers, the cumin lamb noodle in soup and the pulled pork noodles (not in soup) to try out their handpulled noodles.  Food came out quickly and they serve you at the table with a number. The garlic cucumbers were SO GOOD! I loved these - but then again, you can't really screw these up and they are quite standard at a lot of Chinese restaurants. The pulled pork noodles were more flavorful than I thought it would be since there's no chili oil all over it.  The broth was good, pork was good... noodles were THICK! Like... there's quite a lot of inconsistency between each strand or noodle so you can be taking giant bites off and it's quite chewy.  My bf got the cumin lamb spicy noodle in soup and he liked it - not VERY spicy (my spice tolerance is low and even I could manage it) AND he drank all the soup! I think he enjoyed it but it probably upset his stomach a bit to eat all the spice at once. Plus there's a good pool of oil when you get it so it's quite shiny.Overall, $30 lunch for the two of us and the portion sizes were large ($10 per noodle bowl and I think that's a great price for Seattle!).  They have a hot pot station too to make your own which we didn't try but maybe next time! Next to the hot pot station is a sauces station and I used that. There's a variety of EVERYTHING and I love how easy it was; reminds me a lot of China there.  My bf is also allergic to peanuts and I can safely say - he lived! So for anyone else worried about severe allergies to peanuts, I think you're good.  I took off one star because it's not exactly the prettiest restaurant but very efficient (there's even a woman that cleans the tables RIGHT after you leave and if you loiter too long, she shoos you away to make room for other people); very high turnover.  And I took off another star because I mean - it's tasty food but not TO DIE FOR (somewhat oily) and not worth going out of your way for... unless I'm in the university area (which I'll never go on a Saturday during football game time again - hint: traffic is HORRENDOUS when you're leaving haha).",

    "review": "I've been wanting to try this place for the longest time after seeing so many photos of these beautiful hand pulled noodles all over my Instagram feed and so glad I finally got around to it! A perfect spot for quick bite on a cold Seattle night. The hand ripped noodles are all I have ever gotten, and from everyone else's reviews, probably what I should stick to. I've tried the lamb, beef, and pork... all delicious and extremely flavorful. I prefer the beef as I'm not a huge lamb person, but I believe that's their most popular meat. I've stuck to mostly the soup ones considering the colder weather now, but they also have dry noodle options that look amazing! The noodles are fresh and perfectly cooked. The soup isn't too heavy, but it can be slightly on the oilier side depending on what type of soup you're accustomed to. You can add garlic, green onions, chili oil, etc to your heart's desire with their \"spice bar\", and who doesn't love customization?The place isn't anything fancy with tables put together and taken apart to accommodate different sized parties, and it's not unlikely to basically share a table with another party. All part of the experience! Service is normal for Chinese restaurants in the area - lots of people running around and helping out. They gave me lamb when I ordered beef once, and it took a couple tries for them to fix it.. but they eventually did. The place gets pretty packed most nights, but the line moves quickly and the food comes out fast too. Decent priced and definitely a great option if you're in the area!",

    "review": "I was addicted to this place for a while hahah it's one of the most popular Xi'an places in Seattle known for its hand-ripped noodle. Spicy cumin lamb hand-ripped noodle - #1 on their menu and probably the most popular one because it's just so good. I love the classic combination of cumin and lamb, and the spiciness adds more flavor to the noodle. Their noodle are all made by hand so it's wide and chewy, and hard to find in other places. For this dish, however, because it's so popular, they tend to make a lot in advance so you might get a slightly cold one that was made even before you order it. Malatang - aka making your own mini hotpot. This type of dish is not that well-known but I often order it here because not many restaurants offer this. They let you choose how to cook it (spiciness level, with or without soup), and charge you by pound. I recommend to choose the one with meat as the prices don't differ that much with or without meat. Most of the things you can choose from are fresh. There aren't that many but it's good enough for me. Stewed pork hand-ripped noodle - go for this one if you can't eat spicy food at all! I love the flavor of the pork because you can tell they put lots of Chinese spices in it and stew it for really long. I always put more sauce in it (btw love their sauce bar) as this one is a little bit lack of flavor to me. Their paomo, cold noodle, cold dishes, lamb dumplings are also pretty good. I pretty much tried all the food on the menu and there isn't one that I particularly don't like. As for the noodle, I do like the one without the soup better because they taste more flavorful to me but the ones with soup are also perfect for cold weather!",

The dish was very salty - my friend added vinegar to try and cut through some of the salt which helped a bit. There was a nice level of heat, but both those flavors where about it. 2. The noodles were pretty great - good chew and nice long pieces. But since the lamb was pulled/shredded, there wasn't much texture to the dish. Most bites tasted and felt the same. I did enjoy how quickly we got our dishes considering how packed it was. It is evident that this is a popular spot that many people enjoy. The portions were also very large which was a plus. It was nice to try a place that people have been really talking about, but it just wasn't a very balanced dish in my opinion.",

I also ordered a coconut smoothie which was great (but OOPS, a large percentage of diners - ourselves included - head across the street to Snowy Village for bingsoo afterward.  So I had a *lot* of cold refreshment this night).  We also had the Mount Qi Pork Hand-Ripped Noodles and the Hot Oil Spread Hand-Ripped Noodles.  I don't know what a lot of words mean here.  \"Spread\"?  Anyway, these were delicious and satisfying - and yes they were spicy.   We also got 'Shrimp Chives Dumplings' that had so little shrimp in there that a crustacean-despiser like me could even eat them.Negatives?  Our orders came out at random times, and bigger: they plead for 5-star reviews on Yelp.  IS THAT EVEN ALLOWED?  I mean it's not necessary!  Xi'an Noodles totally rules!    We'll be back.",

I came here around 6pm on a Saturday and ordered their cumin lamb noodles in soup, while my girlfriend ordered the non-spicy option with pork. A good bowl of Biang Biang noodles are supposed to have a good balance of \"slurpiness\" and chewiness without getting sticky. While the noodles themselves were quite good (not too thick, not too soft, not too chewy), I wasn't as impressed with the lamb and broth in my noodle soup. The broth was a lot thinner than I expected and tasted a little watered down (my guess is that they just take the dry noodles and add broth). As a result, the cumin flavor was a little weaker than I had anticipated. The lamb itself was well-stewed and lean; you can think of it as \"Chinese Barbacoa.\" The flavors were authentic, but the broth really just watered everything down too much.My girlfriend's non-spicy noodles were pretty bland to be honest. There was little to no flavor in the broth and the meat was kind of dry. If you're put off at all by the idea of cumin lamb, or are intimidated by the \"spicy\" signs, let me tell you this: JUST ORDER THE DRY NOODLES. They aren't that spicy, and the lamb isn't as gamey as you would expect.",

Initially we were excited by the prospect of a new green lake restaurant, and all the more excited when we saw it was getting well reviewed.We decided to try to it out on a Saturday night as we wanted to go somewhere local. Service was welcoming and the space is really nice. Felt quite summery with all the plants.I had the local lettuce salad with champagne vinaigrette. It was so bitter that I could only eat half of it. The endives had somehow made everything in the salad really bitter including the shaved carrot. Very strange. Definitely a flavor fail.For my main I had the pumpkin gnocchi which was generally pretty good though undersalted (which is not something I normally complain about).So overall didn't love my meal and my husband felt similarly about his meal. The other big issue is the price. It cost $170 incl service for two starters, two mains and a cocktail and 2 glasses of wine. That seems an awful lot for a local restaurant.

Kind of late, around 8:30 so it wasn't too busy. Décor is cute. I like that they've brightened the place up from the previous Lucia vide. Initial greeting from the hostess was friendly and we were seated promptly (had a reservation). My overall feeling on this place is that it has good potential and a lot of room to grow. The menu reflects a well thought out approach but some of the flavors in the dishes just didn't quite make sense for me. I love simple, I love complex, I love great food. But if you're going to attempt to elevate your menu with more complexity, you need to do it right. If the components in the dish don't jive, its just an over complicated plate which wasn't well executed. We ordered 2 appetizers, 2 entrees and dessert. Food reviews as follows:Seared Calamari - Not your typical, which was exciting. This was calamari stuffed with chorizo. That part was good! I enjoyed the flavor combo. The accompaniments however (carrot puree, mint), didn't seem to pair well in my opinion. Room for improvement. Black Cod Ceviche - Enjoyed this, fish was fresh and it did have an overall \"bright\" theme to the dish. Some of the pickled items and the overuse of mint didn't quite make sense with the other items but I understand the direction they were going in. Duck Breast - Gahhh. Was so on the fence with this dish. I wanted to love it because the duck was actually cooked perfectly. The skin, my fav was on point but it was way over salted :( and I can handle salt, love salt but even this was a little much for me. The rest of the dish was good overall, nothing which made me scream wow, but nice texture combos with the wild rice and the mostarda and decent depth of flavor. Hanger Steak - Best part of this dish was the sunchokes. Steak and chimichurri were underwhelming and under seasoned. Maybe just not the spot for steak. Olive Oil Brownie - Im a sucker for dessert! and I love olive oil anything. The server sold us on this, indicating that the olive oil kept the brownie super moist, almost gooey. Uh, not the case. This baby was dry. But luckily the sweet cream ice cream was delightful and gave the brownie some moisture assistance. This was a tough review to right because at first glance I think this place should be 5 stars and I can appreciate the creative dishes their going for. Just didn't feel the value was there at this time. I do think i'll give this place another try (and hopefully update my review) as they do serve brunch and i'm always down for a great brunch.

It's nice to have something a little more elevated in the Greenlake area! Some dishes I highly recommend are the Venison + Pork Sausage, the Honey Glazed Half Smoked Chicken, the local lettuces (such a perfect yet simple salad to pair with anything you order!) and you can't go wrong with the oysters- very fresh and perfectly chilled. The hangar steak and crab salad was just OK to me- I felt like my steak was pretty tough to chew and didn't seem like it was salted let alone seasoned. Beautiful presentation nevertheless.Their wine selection is alright. I believe there was only one option by the glass for each type of wine which is fine- but I'd be pleased if they rotate or swap those out because the Cabernet Sauvignon option they offered didn't wow me. Their Rozella drink is delicious if you're in the mood for something fruity. It's just the right amount of sweet/tart/refreshing/satisfying. The Bellini at brunch is great too!If you're there for brunch I suggest the Horchata Pain Perdu for something sweet- it's amazing! Tip: split it with someone. It's massive and even half of it left me feeling quite indulged. The fried oyster hash is also good and a very unique dish at that! Loved both. Can't wait to try more brunch items!I've always had pretty great service here. The staff is polite and professional and you can tell they believe in the food and the chef. The space is bright and clean, it could even stand to be a little more dimly lit in the  evenings in my opinion but that's no reason to complain.

Just FYI if you have kids, they don't have high-chairs but was able to snag a booth which worked ok for the kid. I would say their brunch menu is made up of 25% breakfast and 75% lunch so if you want breakfast food, you might not be satisfied here. Also, prices are pretty high considering most items don't come with hash browns, eggs, etc.... and for the French toast it's literally a huge chunk of bread, while delicious was $15 with just topping and syrup (some fruit would of been nice). I got the eggs benedict and it was delicious and welcomed the side salad but again, I can see some people wanting \"breakfast\" food.Service was ok, I was waiting for my friend to show up and got seated early but would of been nice to have been brought water or asked if I wanted anything to drink (really needed coffee) and waited about 10 minutes until I was acknowledged.",

I ordered a drink on happy hour and it was okay but very strong whiskey taste ( if you love whiskey it was the cherry sour and you would probably love it ) Good deal considering only two drinks on happy hour.I ordered the pickle appetizer and it took over 30 min to come out, the manager said she would comp due to the time. My friend ordered the pasta and she really liked it. I ordered a salad and it was tasty but again a little underwhelmed but the shaved vegetables were unique and good. The pickles finally came and it was all different veggies pickled and the green beans were a flavor explosion so delicious spicy and pickled. We ended with a piece of cherry pie and it was delicious neither too sweet or tangy. The manager brought out ice cream from Lopez Island for my friends birthday and it was yummy.  Overall a 4 star experience it was expensive and the happy hour menu underwhelming the pickles were 10 star with all the different flavors and love pickled vegetables. I will be back excited this is in the hood the hangar steak a nearby table looked delicious.",

I checked out the menu and it looked right up our alley. Being that it was a brand new restaurant I decided to give them some time to work out any kinks or issues... Fast forward to November 9th. My partner and I wanted to go out for a date night and some cocktails. We are big foodies and were very excited to check this place out, so we came in for a late night dinner. The waitstaff was very attentive from the moment we walked in. Our server was excellent and we were often checked on by the manager, I presume? One of my favorite things is asking my server their opinion about certain dishes. You can tell if someone takes their job seriously by this. I hate when I get a 'they're both good' response. HERE IS THE KICKER... she explained both of them beautifully, I chose which one I wanted and then she sent me a COMPLIMENTARY portion of the other dish I was interested in. If that is not exceptional service I don't know what is! Other info.. cocktails were tasty! Yes, the eggplant dish is a little expensive at $15, but it's so worth it. I've never had eggplant taste that good. Pork chop was FIRE. Gnocchi was the free item I got and it was DIVINE with little pickled mushrooms. The dessert was the only thing I don't have a rave review on. Apple pie. It was fine, but I prefer a little more texture on the apple part of the pie. If you like high end food with a spicy kick this place is for you!",

It looked like at one point they were turning the lights down but then decided against it. I am not sure why it was so bright but it was a little overwhelming. The lights along with the decor would be perfect for a  brunch spot which they have so will have to try it some Sunday. I wasn't that impressed with the food. I had a salad that was overdressed and ordered the clams because someone had said the broth was fantastic. I thought it was just so so.

    "review": "The food is good. The menu has a lot of seafood options, and it also uses seasonal ingredients, which I love.It took a while for our server to come to us and to pour us water. It was slightly annoying that she first greeted and took orders from a table that came later than us. I'll chalk all this up to opening day jitters, it's super easy to sort out afterall.The main issue I take with Eight Row is that it's just too expensive for what it is. The cheapest item on the menu is pickles, at $7(!!) \"Local lettuces\" is the second cheapest, at $13. The fried eggplant appetizer we ordered, while absolutely delicious, was $15. This is why I can't give the restaurant a higher rating. For comparison, one of Venice Beach's best restaurants, Gj*l*n*, charges slightly cheaper prices for equivalent dishes, and its overall ambiance and service is higher quality and feels more special than Eight Row. Don't get me wrong, the inside of Eight Row looks cute, but it doesn't feel $100 for two people ($50/person!!!) on a Tuesday night cute. We didn't even order alcohol or dessert! Actually, I take that back, we ordered one $5(!!!)\"Peach Rosemary Soda\" that was literally just sparkling water, lol. You could not taste even a HINT of peach.. maybe just a hint if rosemary. No sweetness, either. Just call it sparkling water, please.Overall, I'm happy Greenlake finally has a nicer, more upscale restaurant and I really wish all the best for Eight Row. It is such a huge step up from the restaurant that was in the space before (Lucia Italian). It's just going to take scaling down the menu prices, or upping the interior of the restaurant to feel.. classier.. to get me to come back.",

The restaurant serves Mala Tang and a variety of appetizers.Food: The Beef and Lamb malatang came with a generous portion of food. The portion size of the Malatag seems like it could be split between two people. The broth is really creamy and not too spicy. The meat and the broth mixed together seems like a good balance and blend.  I also really like the other things in the malatang like the fish tofu and the corn. The braised duck is by far my favorite item here. The meat is so tender and nearly pulls apart when you take it off. I will also say that the duck was extremely flavorful and every bite had flavor to it. The chicken cutlet was kind of average and didn't seem too special. I wish the chicken cutlet came out hot and that it would be a tad more flavorful. It definitely seem like it was on the more bland side. The string green beans tasted good and was a good veggie for our meal.Service: The server was pretty attentive and checked in on us consistently throughout the lunch. When we went to pay, they even help us pack up the food and seal the malatang for easier storage. Price: While this can be a tad bit expensive, it seems definitely worth the price. The quantity of the food definitely matched the quality.Overall, I would really like! Definitely a go to place for lunch when I'm craving malatang. I would love to try more of their appetizers next time.",

From my opinion I think the chicken are juicy and tender, fries are fries, but I would prefer the sauce should put on separate container so we can dip it, because not all people like sauce, and it didn't make the dish look good but messy. I love the honey mustard sauce and I wish they will add more. The Fishcake is pretty good with the sweet and spicy sauce (Thai chili sauce)! I highly recommend this dish! I mentioned about the drinks before on my last review, however it is still too overwhelmingly sweet for us! I ordered 50% sugar this time just in case and my friend ordered 100% I think. Mine it tasted like 100% and his is like 1000%. So please adjust the sweetness. The surf and turf MalaTang was pretty good, I ordered spicy this time, it's not too crazily spicy, that was the right amount of spicy for me, and I had to add more chili oil, oh I have to mention their chili oil! It's really good and flavorful! Garlic pork belly with rice was okay, for some reason the pork were a littler watery, and I wish there would be more garlic since it said mashed garlic (??) but there was no garlic on the meat, and I could only taste the hint of garlic, but the rice with the meat was good and I like to mix some malatang soup in it. Overall I would say good! 7/10 The drinks need to be improved!!",

I did see a fair bit of other asian customers,  so this is a good initial sign the food is going to be good and authentic. The service is a tad slow, but just flag down the servers if you need anything instead of expecting them to check on you (nothing out of the ordinary for Asian restaurants).For being in the freemont area, the prices are fair for what you get. The portions are good while not being overly expensive: $11-15 an entree. I tried a variety of the dishes and it looks like basic fare: a combination of soups, simple rice dishes paired with a protein, a side and sauces,  and various street foods for appetizers. Beef noodle soup 5/5 - very well done, with a great balancing of flavors while not getting too heavy. Reminds me of what I actually got in taiwan!Mala dumps 4/5 - these were good, and the broth was super flavorful with lots of the mala kick! Unfortunately the dumplings were nothing crazy but they were good either way!Crispy turnip cake 5/5 - light, oily,  soft on the inside and crispy on the outside, served with a garlic soy crack sauce. Scallion pancakes 5/5 - light, crispy, and fluffy with many layers. Couldn't have done this any better, and also served with the garlic soy crack sauce. Twice roasted milk tea 4/5 - although this was good, it didnt blow my mind. At least the boba was cooked to the wrong consistency!Overall, I enjoyed my experience here without killing my wallet! I wouldn't come back again in the near future as I'd prefer to explore other spots, but I'd highly recommend checking it out at least once!",

Our trip was on a rainy day, upon walking in, the place was PACKED.  The smell of hours cooked batches of hot goodness was in the air. Sure they feature bubble tea also, but they really want you to go for the malatang.. a type of Chinese street food that originated in Sichuan. If you are thinking Hot Pot, my answer is, more like a hot bowl of soup. You can get their house version, which has everything you can think about putting into it, or customize.  We had that, and it was pretty darn tasty. Service was great too, friendly, and we enjoyed the experience.

I lived in Taiwan for 3 months and all I did was eat, eat, and eat. Now I can do the same in Seattle. Good luck to this laowai and his poor stomach. We went for happy hour, which is essentially $1 off an extensive list of appetizers and some beers. Most things were good, some things were great and others were excellent. QQ Milk Tea - got 80% sweetness as per the server's recommendation but think regular would have been fine too. The tea was very flavorful. The boba were a little too chewy but nothing too upsetting as it was consistent. Overall a very good milk tea, especially for a non specialized boba store! Garlic green beans - these were good but nothing special. They were fresh and balanced some of the other greasier fried foods that we ordered. Scallion Pancake (??????) - I dare say that this was the best green onion pancake that I have ever had outside of China or Taiwan. The dough was perfectly oily, crispy and flakey. The addition of a fried egg is rare to come by and elevated this simple dish even further. The accompanying dipping sauce was a sweet, garlic soy which was divine. I'll be back just for this. 19 GOLD Fries - great hangover food of popcorn chicken over fries served with three sauces - ketchup, mustard, and condensed milk (???). Kinda weird but kinda great. Got the sauces on the side. The chicken was flavorful and tender, but could have been a tad crispier. Braised Duck Wings - something I've never encountered before but now I'm hooked. Big portion for the price. I asked the waiter how these are cooked as they were sweet from soy braising but also slightly crunchy like chicken wings. Turns out they deep fry these bad boys just before serving. So much yum -- a must order! Lamb Malatang - we opted for the extra rich broth which was honestly fantastic. However, it came warm and not hot probably due to the frozen toppings being added in. The waiter promptly corrected this by heating it up. The dish felt a little light on the toppings so I may try something else soup based next time. You get unlimited rice but we had so much other food that we didn't need a refill. Fried buns with condensed milk - Like any good relationship, there is always something that let's you down, but you put up with it for the greater good. These buns were just that. They were far too oily and heavy to eat more than one or two. These are meant to be soft in the inside and break apart like a mantou, not extra crispy like some kind of deep fried churro. Either they were cut too skinny before frying or the consistency of their dough is off. Hoping they fix these as I love myself some sweet buns. Overall a great dining experience with fantastic, attentive service, delicious food, and a great variety of menu options. I will certainly be back for more GOLD(en scallion pancake).

The happy hour menu is extensive offering $1 off most of the appetizers and some beers. With the exception of the fried buns, everything tasted excellent. Our server was wonderful and checked up on us often. Even with some minor flaws, this place still gets 5 stars due to the great taste, service, and value. 7 items came to $56 and paid with Venmo/cash so we received an additional 5% off. QQ Milk Tea:Ordered this 80% sweet per the waiter's recommendation and it was just sweet enough. The tea had great flavor. Comparable to some of the better boba shops in Seattle. The boba could have been softer but it was consistent. Would definitely order the milk tea againGarlic Green Beans:Standard garlic greens and tasted yummy as expected. A little on the bland side but I don't mind as you can always add a little salt. Green Onion Pancake:Dare I say the best green onion pancake I've had. We added egg on it which was a great addition. The pancake was so crispy and flaky yet still soft in the middle. The dipping sauce that accompanied was a good balance of sweet and savory. Braised Duck Wings:Tons of flavor and great texture. A rather big portion too. The waiter says it is braised then fried right before serving. 19 Gold Fries:Basically popcorn chicken and fries with 3 sauces. We opted for sauce on the side which I recommend if you don't like your fries messy. The chicken was nice and crispy. One of the sauces served with it was condensed milk which I thought was weird but was surprisingly good. Lamb Malatang:We chose to get this with the extra rich broth which added wonderful depth of flavor. The soup was loaded with toppings and came with an unlimited side of rice. The soup came out only slightly warm. I figured all the toppings must have cooled the soup. The waiter was quick to warm up the soup for me when requested. Fried Buns with Condensed Milk:I love fried buns but this was the only underwhelming part of the meal. The buns came out too greasy. Probably from being cut too thin or overfried or both. I wouldn't order this again unless the buns were cut thicker next time.",

However I recognized most of the ingredients and saw some typical dishes like the onion pancake, etc.My friends and I stopped in on a rainy evening and grabbed the last four top table. The place is pretty tiny. We ordered the onion pancake and popcorn chicken to start - they were both delicious! The pancake was the crispiest version of this dish that I've ever had. It was flavorful and not too greasy. The popcorn chicken was super crispy and the coating was seasoned well. I would definitely order both of those items again.My boyfriend and I shared the house special Mala tang. You get to customize this dish with your choice of broth, level of spiciness, protein choice, and side option (vermicelli or rice). We got the regular broth, but they also have a spicy version and a super rich version that has milk in it. We went with a low spice level and beef as our protein. The house special dish comes with tons of stuff including lotus root, tofu, tofu skin, fish cake, lobster ball, quail egg, broccoli, corn, enoki mushroom, crab stick, and other things! I liked most everything except for the seaweed knot. The meat wasn't super flavorful and doesn't really add anything to the dish. The broth was flavorful and really tasty. It's basically hotpot you don't cook yourself.If I went back I would build my own bowl, now that I know what everything is and what I liked the best.

Next time I'd definitely go with regular ice, because the drink was still a little warm at the bottom, but that's just a sign of fresh made pearls. Their tea that they use is really good, and their actual pearls have a great consistency. The Peach Oolong Milk Tea was solid. Didn't taste much of the peach flavor, but their oolong really shines. The Deep Fried Golden Buns were super nostalgic. I grew up eating these (steamed not fried). The condensed milk really makes he dish. I probably wouldn't order these again because the buns soak up a lot of the vegetable oil taste. Im not mad that I ordered this dish though. The Steamed Pork Belly with Sweet Garlic Sauce was a winner for me. The clean steamed taste of the pork works really well with the sweet sauce. Adding their chili sauce really completes the dish in my opinion. OVERALLGreat spot for boba. I want to come back and try their Mala Tang that they're known for and definitely to get that QQ Milk Tea again. I've also heard great things about their happy hour.",

    "review": "Finally got to try 19 GOLD over the weekend and it didn't disappoint! However I do want to dispel a few things that others have written about parking and discounts. They do NOT have designated parking spots at all (saw someone write that they had 3 but confirmed that they don't), it's just street parking or paid parking nearby. Also, you don't get a 10% discount if you check in on Yelp, but you do get 5% off your bill if you pay with Venmo or cash.Now onto the food, the braised meat/tofu appetizer was really legit. The delicious soy and tea flavors were all there like you'd find in Taipei.I also really enjoyed my fried chicken steak with rice. The chicken was tender, not dry and stringy, and the batter was addicting. I would order this again.My friend didn't like her mala soup as well as I liked my rice, but she really enjoyed the appetizer too.I'd come back to try the other dishes but Fremont street parking is a pain so will try to come during off hours.",

    "review": "I've been on a Taiwanese food kick lately, and found out that not only did 19Gold recently open, but that it is only 10 minutes from my apartment! The menu was surprisingly large for a new restaurant and the service is great. When I went a couple weeks ago, they had a lot of promo deals where you can save up to 15% on your meal, so definitely check to see if they have any promos still. I believe they also have a loyalty club that you can join to get extra freebees. I ordered the steamed rice with minced pork, a peach tea, and a Special Malatang bowl. I was surprised to see that the serving sizes are quite large, especially for the Malatang bowl. I was a bit worried about the minced pork bowl since I've had multiple instances where the pork-rice ratio was lacking, but I'm happy to report that 19Gold doesn't skimp on the meat! Everything came out piping hot and the servers do their best to accommodate for any changes that you'd like to make to your dish. I will say that it does get crowded since the restaurant itself is pretty small, so try to avoid during peak hours if possible. That being said, Fremont is a great area to walk around and explore if you wind up getting put on the waitlist. There is also street parking, which can get scarce too, so be mindful when driving here that you may have to park several blocks away and walk. That being said, the walk is definitely worth trying out the food!",

    "review": "The photos posted the past four months definitely piqued my interest to check out 19 Gold in Seattle's Fremont neighborhood. The College Friend selected this out of the choices given to choose from for her birthday (9/8/19). Despite the nearby Fremont Sunday Market, I had no problem getting nearby free street parking.We arrived a few minutes before the 1130 opening, but were kindly seated at a two top, handed menus and water. The other tables filled up shortly thereafter for lunch. So many choices from their vast food and beverage menu!I ended up ordering the Crispy Honey Prawns with Pineapple ($10.95), the Taiwanese Sausage with seasoned egg, two vegies, and steamed rice with minced pork ($10.95), and a Hokkaido Milk Tea 50% sweetness/50% ice ($4.50).The College Friend selected the House Special Malatang bowl with super rich broth, chicken, and all the fixings ($14.95) and received minced pork over rice ($2).All the food were brought out nice and piping hot, where applicable.Why the missing star from perfection?*Ugh for tepid water, despite being kept well hydrated with refills.*Expediting was uneven. I was practically done eating before The College Friend's orders arrived at the table. I suspect the identical orders brought to adjacent tables who were seated after us, were actually hers.*asked for noodles, she got rice. With the wait time, decided to not comment any further.*way too much mayo coating the prawns, or as the receipt referred to as creaming sauce.Pro tips:Arrive right at opening, you'll get seated and served at a reasonable time. Be kind and do your part to not dither, so others can be seated after you.Join their loyalty club, you'll earn free food/drink with accrued points. Ask the waitperson or manager for the separate touch pad and enter your phone number. Enunciate clearly though...I am now Murie in their system, not Marie.Pay at your table with efficient hand held device, just like I've seen used up in Vancouver, BC.Despite a previously posted tip from another Yelper, there was no applicable Yelp discount.Special mention:Great customer service! From start to finish, it was spot on. And thank you to David the manager! Despite the minor stuff mentioned, definitely there will be future return visits. Thank you for the passionfruit green tea ($3.75 value) bestowed upon The College Friend for her birthday. Generous gesture!19 Gold is a decent, tasty dining experience located at the center of the universe (aka Fremont). Just a diagonal football toss away from the Lenin statue.",

    "review": "19 Gold has got to have the best values for taiwanese food. They even have HAPPY HOUR on top of their great prices! Where else can you get a large pork belly rice bowl for $5 in Seattle? As of the date I wrote this review, they also offer free pork refills for your bowl! Where does any other restaurant in Seattle do that?? So delicious. They also have pretty great boba milk tea. Plus, they're so close to where I reside. I'm sold! Located in the heart of Fremont, it's a great location for their business. They also have patio seating, which is nice for the warmer weathers here in Seattle. They have plenty of taiwanese snacks and I have tried a couple so far, including their popcorn chicken/19 gold fries, deep fried golden buns, taiwanese braised combo platter. For their entrees, I have tried the malatang house special, malatang soup dumplings, and pork belly/minced pork over rice. Everything was solid. They also have kid friendly options, including a rice plate on a car shaped tray, which is super adorable! So if you have kids, I'm sure they can enjoy this place too.As for the milk teas, they definitely sweetened them far lower than the normal standard. I'm a person that usually gets 30-50% sugar level for my milk teas at other locations, but the way they make it is already significantly reduced in sugar. When I got jasmine milk tea and yogurt green tea at 30%, it literally taste like there was 0% sugar in both lol. So if you like some sweetener in your milk tea, I recommend starting at 50-70% then judge from there if you would reduce it some more or not. Otherwise, the milk tea and boba is great! I recommend the Japanese twice-roasted milk tea and jasmine milk tea. I've already came here a couple times and will probably visit some more, since it's such a great hang out spot or a quick pick-me up. So glad they opened a boba place in Fremont!",

This place served food that was between Jersey Italian-American and artisanal regional Italian cuisine if that makes sense. Like they at least have the decency not to batter and fry their calamari... But they do have your heavy sauces if you want your pasta that way. We enjoyed our pasta dishes and the service was very warm. It's not the cheapest meal but was quite reasonable everything considered.For specifics: I'm not sure how I feel about the bread. It's served warm (which was fantastic!) but I just wish it has a little bit more crust and bite. The pasta we had was al dente and the sauces had a pretty good balance.

I asked for a side of parsley and was given some chiffonade basil lol that actually worked! It just needed a little brightness to balance the heavy creaminess of it.

I ordered two kinds of gnocchi - with Bolognese sauce and with Gorgonzola sauce. Both turned to paste as soon as I opened the containers at home. I don't live too far away, so they didn't travel a long distance. When I transferred them to a bowl, I assumed the pasty substance I saw might have been cheese, however it turned out to be the disintegrating gnocchi themselves. Now, I have a bowl of cream sauce flavored paste and Bolognese sauce flavored paste. I can't finish it. The texture is like eating raw bread dough. Maybe these aren't the traditional potato gnocchi that I'm used to, but if this is pasta dough, ITS RAW.

The chicken was moist, the breading was delicious, and the heat was just perfect (I will likely never go beyond the medium). Staff were friendly too for the amount of interaction I had with them. They have hand wipes too which come in .... handy... :)I saw others get fries, mac & cheese etc., which look good, but I stuck to the chicken sandwich which was super filling (ate it at 1pm, still wasn't hungry that night!).

Once you get inside it is more of a modern farmhouse vibe. The restaurant is decent sized with tables all around.The menu is on the smaller side but there are still a lot of options to choose from. For shared dishes we ended up trying the corn bread and chicken gizzards. I had never had chicken gizzard before but I ended up liking it. The corn bread was okay and later on accompanied the entrees really nicely. I got the Fried Chicken Terrine with greens & chili aioli. It was a good chicken sandwich, the best? Not the best but pretty satisfying. I also tried the collard greens which were really good but I am not a collard greens expert so I am not sure how they would rate on the scale.

This is not your typical Southern comfort food. This is fancy Southern food with a French twist as our server explained that the chef trained in France. The highlights of the meal were the cornbread and the oxtail. The cornbread was crispy, rich and dense. The oxtail was tender and the meat was falling off the bone. The most disappointing thing about the meal were the desserts. The descriptions sounded enticing but the preparation was lacking. There was random mint leaves in both desserts. The spiced cookie on the ice cream sandwich was too strong and overwhelmed the more delicate flavors of the ice cream. The aprium betty was like a soggy crumble. The smoked carrots didn't have any smoky flavor that I could detect. The cheese grits that came with the catfish was better than the catfish itself. I would rather order the grits as a side and skip the catfish entirely even though the server said the catfish was very popular. Be prepared to spend a bit more if you want to sample the menu because there's also 20% automatic gratuity included. Verdict: 3.5 stars. I would not come back again for dinner because I felt like it was just too expensive for what it was worth to me but I am interested in trying out their lunch selection.

Overall the food was local and well portioned for sharing. Flavours were balanced and creative, avoiding being overwhelmingly bold.

The brisket was juicy and cooked perfectly, but unseasoned and didn't really have a whole lot of flavor. The serving size was on the small side of 1 slice of meat considering the price was $25.The coleslaw and bean salad were fresh, but there was not a whole lot of flavor or creativity with it to make it stand out from anything. The first dish was amazing and brought together a medley of flavors, textures and sauce that made it amazing. Everything after that was pretty plain and a little underwhelming. I expected the \"Friday Brisket Dinner\" to stand out as something special since it is a \"only once a week\" kind of thing and a little more expensive than the regular menu items. I was wrong.I understand this isn't really a BBQ place, but when you serve it as a special item on Friday and Saturday nights, I expect something better.If you're in the mood for brisket (or BBQ in general), coleslaw and bean salads with flavor, I would recommend Jack's BBQ instead. Better brisket, larger portions, and a little less expensive.I would still come back to this place eventually to try other things. The smoked quail, catfish, and fried chicken  (Sundays only) looked good. For me, it hasn't really lived up to all the hype and hoopla of other reviews that call it \"an experience\"...

To the reviewer that said they were dry and needed more butter - I am not sure what to think. I mean...really? We got two desserts - the chocolate cream pie and the banana bread pudding - both were to die for. Sweet but not too sweet. Just perfect. Our server was friendly, helpful, and cheerful.

A friend and I went on the recommendation of an old professor and we were (mostly) not disappointed.The waitlist is managed through the Q app, which is a little weird; they charge $5 to hold your place in line but only if the wait time is greater than 20 minutes. The app fluctuated between 10 and 40 minutes throughout the early evening, so we decided to not add our name to the Q. Luckily when we arrived, we were immediately seated.The waitress then gave the most detailed explanation of a menu I have ever received in my life. It probably took 5 minutes to go through the menu, but you were left with zero questions after she walked you through it. Always helpful when the waitstaff knows and understands the menu.I settled on the oxtail and we split cornbread to start. The cornbread was good, and the molasses sauce on top was fabulous. It was a bit small, but our entrees arrived pretty quickly after the cornbread, so it ended up not mattering. The oxtail was fabulous--fell right off of the bone and into the light garlicky sauce. My friend got the brisket dinner, and while she enjoyed it, I don't think she felt it was worth the $25 price tag (the brisket was good but not amazing when I tried it).As mentioned, service was fabulous, and we were in an out in a reasonable hour and change. The dinner set us back about $75 including tax and the mandatory 20% gratuity (although I do appreciate that on the menu they specify exactly where this goes).I would be happy to return again if I'm back in the area, although with the amount of places to try in Seattle, it may be a bit before I find myself at JuneBaby again.",

Space was tight. We were able to get the last 2 bar seats at 7:30pm on a Saturday night with an anticipated 30-minute wait for a table. A table opened up within 10 minutes but we sat at the bar where a lot of the action was. Highly recommend.",

There was still counter seating available and one table for two left. We ordered the fried mushrooms which were amazing. The shrimp gumbo was good. It was my first gumbo so not sure what to compare it too... but lots of meat. The cornbread was also outstanding. The BBQ dinner was huge portion and 32$. Great price for the size. The brisket and pulled pork was great. The ribs were a little dry, but the sausage link was good and the vegetables were great! The beans were alright, just cause I'm not a huge bean person. OVERALL, was very pleased with all the food, but only giving 4 stars for the service. Our waiter wasn't great, took a while to take our order and messed up the bills and just wasn't that nice.",

The cups all say \"eat like you give a damn!\" which I find really cute. There's also a little bar with fruits and whipped cream and a ton of other toppings for if you order certain things on the menu (pancakes, french toast, waffles, etc.) which make good meals even better! I always order one of the varieties of eggs benedict which are absolutely delicious. My boyfriend always orders some sort of pancake so he can go to the toppings bar, and neither of us have had any complaints. The wait on the weekends is always SUPER long, but pro tip- you CAN make a reservation on Yelp (I made mine at 11pm the night before once) and it cuts the wait time down by a ton! While this place is great, it isn't necessarily my FAVORITE spot to go, but it sure is up there! The price is a little high in my opinion considering how many other places around the University you can go for a great brunch for a cheaper price, but there is certainly nothing wrong with the food at Portage Bay! If you're looking for somewhere to go on a cute date or somewhere to take your family when they're visiting for a weekend, this is probably the type of spot you wanna go!",

Made a reservation online but still had to wait outside for a bit. The atmosphere is clean and bright, noise level was quite high. The food took really long~40 minutes- to get to us, and i was hangry. I ordered the classic benedict and we shared the classic pancakes. The food looked amazing (see pic)! Classic benedict: super yummy and surprisingly really filling. I'd consider myself to have a big appetite but I was feeling full after one benedict(maybe because i starved for too long)? The ham was pleasantly flavorful with a nice crisp which was delicious in conjunction with the pouched egg and sauce. I chose the salad option and it added a nice balance to the heavier content of the benedicts. Classic pancakesI was worried that the the portion would be small since there's only two pancakes but they were actually thick and the almost size of the plate. We made the rookie mistake of piling too much fruit on the pancakes which made them slightly soggy:( . The fruit bar is a cool idea, but the variation is slightly limiting and the berries looked a bit squished. Left with a FULL belly and happy belly. Only complaint was the excruciating wait time for our food to arrive.",

Hats off to you if you can finish this dish! Even better, you can walk around U-Dub just down the street to come out of your food coma.If you're a fan of omlettes and seafood, their Dungeness crab omlette is awesome. For its pricetag, there's a solid amount of fresh crab that's complimented well by the other ingredients. An honorable mention is their pancakes (and unlimited toppings bar).

We did end up waiting closer to 40 minutes but of course wait times are just an estimate so not a big deal.Service was a bit slow, but understandably so since they were so busy. I had the pork belly benedict (special), my friend had the crab benedict, and we shared an oatmeal cobbler french toast. Food took a while to come out and both of my eggs were pretty overcooked - no yolk leaked out when I cut into them. The pork belly was a little tough and had very little flavor on its own. My friend enjoyed her crab benedict even though her eggs were slightly overcooked too.The french toast was good and the breakfast bar was definitely very cool, but nothing about it was particularly exceptional, especially at the price point its at.I had high hopes for this place but the long wait time, slow service, and high prices let me down a bit.

Snagging meter parking at this location is also almost impossible, so bus/walk/park in nearby garage shared with hotel. I made a reservation an hour in advance using Yelp and am so glad I did because there was a huge crowd waiting outside for Sunday brunch. Favorite dishes: French toast & farmers hash w/corned beef. Let me say, the farmers hash is THE BEST hash you will ever taste in your life. I promise. Love Portage Bays commitment to using only locally sourced ingredients!Unfortunately because it's so popular on the weekends, it seems like the quality of the food has been going down :'( my favorite French toast was burned so the bread wasn't the soft squishy melt in your mouth texture that I love. Also the fruit bar was all frozen fruits - half were frozen, half were floating in the thawed water - which was pretty disappointing because they normally have fresh sliced strawberries! Perhaps they were not in season anymore. The Roosevelt location used to be my favorite because the outdoor seating area is beautiful and there's a cute mini farm next door. But I have to say, the Portage Bay on 65th is much less crowded so the food is pretty consistent. There's also plenty of parking in the neighborhoods nearby and the interior is quite also, so I might be going there more often?? Regardless, I still love Portage Bay with all my heart!",

It comes with 3 eggs, potatoes, a choice between bacon, turkey and sausage, and pancakes (berry bar included). Personally, I was a bit disappointed by the smaller variety of fruits in the berry bar, and the selection available seemed to consist of primarily fruit from cans/frozen fruit. However, the Swedish pancakes themselves tasted amazing, and the ability to customize toppings allowed me to enjoy pancakes the way I wanted them. The egg/potato/sausage combo complemented well with the sweetness of the pancakes.Overall, this brunch was very filling and was great for our group of 8 people.",

I'm gluten-free and I greatly appreciate the several gluten-free options on the menu and the fact that I've never flared with my medical condition after eating here (gluten has the potential to cause a painful flare for me), however, the gluten-free toast tastes awful - bland, with a displeasing texture - so I almost always decline it.The ambiance is not great either - not much thought put into chairs, tables, vibe, or decor.All that being said, I'm a regular because what they do right, I really love. The farmer's hash is incredible - especially with the salmon added to it.The migas (which they can serve gluten-free, minus the tortillas) are extremely tasty, incredibly filling, and deeply satisfying.The huevos rancheros are well above average, as long as you compare them to other Seattle offerings of the same dish, rather than comparing them to huevos rancheros meals at restaurants in Texas or Southern California.The dungeness crab omelet is to-die-for. If I lived next door to Portage Bay, instead of a 20 - 30 minute drive away, I might have this omelet for breakfast almost every day. Unbelievably delicious combination of flavors.Portage Bay Cafe Roosevelt is also the go-to place for me and my very close friend of 10 years, Ashley (when we're not whipping up homemade jambalaya or other homemade delights on the stove from scratch, that is!). Ashley and I have gone to Portage Bay Cafe for both of our Birthdays, for New Year's Day brunch (a great and tasty way to welcome in the New Year!), on random Saturdays (they're VERY busy on Saturdays - expect a wait), and more. I mean, it's not totally fair, but Ashley is a fantastic conversationalist and she's one of my coolest, most interesting, most fun, most loyal, and most caring friends, so the fact that I've gone to Portage Bay with her so many times, well, it's definitely gonna influence my star rating, ha.

We also ordered a classic French toast, because we were scared that the banana one would be too sweet as advised by our server.

The whipped cream was extremely tasty. Originally, I only got a small scoop as I'm not a big fan of it.

It was a Thursday and while it was probably 75% full, it wasn't so busy that we should've been neglected for literally the entire meal. I arrived before him so was sat, someone brought two waters to the table and checked in that I was waiting for another person. When my boyfriend arrived, our server checked for drink orders and then came back in a bit for food. Our server had around 6 tables and I could see that he definitely wasn't just standing around. We are both servers and bartenders, so normally don't stress if our server has other things to attend to. I ordered the ahi tuna club and my boyfriend ordered the bacon cheeseburger. The food itself was decent, that I would've given three stars for. However, after our food was delivered by another support staff/chef, we were not checked on a SINGLE time for an hour until I set my card out on the table to pay. The table next to us was extremely needy and kept physically stopping the busser to get them what they needed. Honestly I wanted to tip the busser for how much he was running around for this section. But throughout eating our food, not a single person came to ask how it was or if we needed anything. We were going to ask for more dipping sauce and more napkins, which in themselves aren't a huge deal, but we watched tables around us get service and were pretty disappointed in the overall experience. After I set my card out, the server came by to take our payment and even though it was sitting right in front of me, assumed it was my boyfriend paying and handed it to him to sign. I'm normally a 20-25% tipper but I only tipped 18% and was doing that to make sure the busser got something in the tip out. Food was tasty enough, but the service and experience was extremely negligible. One can find decent food many places around the village, where they will actually get checked on throughout their meal.",

Albeit, the wine pours were favoring the restaurant.2nd, the food tonight was mediocre.  My son ordered the burger plain and said that it tasted like pickles.  They must have been lazy...and just took a pre-cooked patty and removed the fixings thinking they could get away with it.  The Baja tacos were just ok...nothing spectacular.  The Salmon was a bad cut,...and had little flavor.The good: Hibachi wings as the appetizer and the fries.Another note:Although the waiter had an accident and spilled wine on my wife, he actually put that wine on our tab, and if we didn't catch it...we would have been charged for being drenched.  Instead, why wouldn't they compensate her a glass?We hope this was just an off night.  We may look around a little more before committing to this place.**we had a 40 minute wait tonight as well...and no one was offered the \"complimentary\" champagne!!  No consistency!--//break//--This was our second time at Joey Kitchen in U-Village.  The first time we came for lunch, they unexpectedly offered us a glass of champagne when we walked in; what a treat!! This time, it was lunch time again,...and the champagne was in a bucket sitting on ice...but wasn't offered to us as we walked in.  Instead, I had to ask...and the hostess gave my wife and I a look as if we did something wrong,...but said \"of course\". I don't think this place deserves a 3 star because the service at the bar was good, and the food was pretty good; although it was just lunch.  The fries are good - skinny fries that are crispy.  The California chicken sandwich was ok- more bun than anything else (the chicken was cut really thin and barely noticed it was on the sandwich).  My wife ordered the protein burger with only lettuce and tomato and received it full of pickles.  However, it's a pretty good spot that we'll come back after we try a few more in the U-District.  $75 for two lunch plates and 2 drinks each.",

Ordered rotisserie chicken for me and chicken parm for my company, and about 30 minutes after placing the order, after me and my company finished our appetizer (fries), the server comes to the table to tell me \"the chicken parm is ready to come out, but I don't know what happened but the POS system won't let me order rotisserie chicken, we must be out of it is there something else you wanted?\" Took a lot for me to not get extremely frustrated. How do you find out when one of two of the order is already table-ready to tell me that there isn't food coming for me? Just another day of bad of service.. I ended up ordering the braised beef which was delicious. Never had any issues til my past 2 experiences!",

Your not greated with any aromatic smells after seeing an open food prep area. Any how when the food arrives its presented in such a way this must be very fancy and high class however that moment you take a bite it all comes to you. This is just ordinary food nothing special.  No great taste and very over priced. Nowhere is it labeled organic to possibly justify the price. So all in all the price destroys the review.  For the serving size and quality of food the price should probably be about 15- 20 % less. Dont be fooled by looks. The food is not as good as every other aspect of this establishment.  Would I come back? Sure I would. If the club stops in and wants to eat here. I would not come by myself.",

Food: We tried the tomato over egg, twice cooked pork, and braised pork ribs with potato. The tomato and egg had fresh tomato with juice from the tomato on the bottom. The eggs were cooked runny and not dried at all. Their twice cooked pork was very flavorful and a very unique dish from Northern China. Their braised pork ribs with potato and beans was actually my favorite dish. I thought the pork ribs were braised really well with a mix of Chinese seasoning. the potatoes added a good starch to the dish and the spices made it tasty.Service: The service is definitely better if you speak Chinese, but definitely do-able if you only speak English. The first time I came here, we ordered in English and the service was prompt and nice.Overall, I really like Little Duck and I think it makes a wonderful addition to the lack of quality Chinese food in the University District.",

The location is great, 8min walk from uw red square, across the street from all the residence halls. The free parking spots available next to the restaurants are definitely a plus.First time I came with my friends and we ordered the Cumin Chicken and Shredded Potato with Jalapeno. The Cumin Chicken was pretty crispy, but the ratio of batter to the actual chicken is off. Too much flour while less chicken for a whole plate of basically chicken tempura (fried in batter). Plus, there is barely anything cumin taste in the chicken and no dipping sauce on the side. I had to ask for some ketchup because I am pretty sure they won't have sweet and sour. For a dish that costs 14 bucks, I would say it is not really worth it. My friend and I did not even bother to finish it, because it got kinda boring after a few bits. On the other hand, the Shredded Potato with Jalapeno is pretty authentic and good. Don't worry about it being spicy because of the Jalapeno, it is not spicy at all. Second time I came alone and ordered a bowl of rice with the highly praised Eggplant with Garlic Sauce--also known as one of my all time favorite Chinese dishes. Honestly, this eggplant dish is bathed in the sweet garlic sauce and flavorful, but it gets too greasy to my taste after a few bites. You need to eat it with rice. When I first took a bite of the eggplant, it was crispy on the outside and soft on the inside, but the eggplant kinda stuck to my teeth :/ I am not sure if I am used to this kinda cooking style, but if you are all about da grease and fry, by all means, give it a try. tldr: Overall, i would give this restaurant a meh.

However once I walked in the door I got really excited. Whenever no English is being spoke, it's generally a good sign. That being said, there is a bit of a language barrier so either brush up on that Mandarin or get used to pointing a lot. The food here was incredible, if a bit expensive. Everything was served fresh and you could tell they used fresh ingredients. The mapo tofu was delicious with a kind of floral taste to it that you usually don't get at other places. The eggplant with garlic sauce was incredible as well. The eggplant has a slight crust on it and the garlic sauce really enhanced the flavors. The double cooked pork in my opinion was the least impressive of the dishes. It was really good, but for the price it wasn't quite what I would have hoped it would be. Overall was very impressed and I'll definitely be back.",

Twice Cooked Pork has always been divided into \"team ketchup\" and \"team vinegar\". To be honest, I couldn't care less because both are amazing. Little Duck is team ketchup. Again, I don't have a specific preference and I think they did a good job. Bok Choy was very fresh, and they use dried mushrooms for more intense flavors. Unlike many Chinese restaurants that dumps corn starch on veggies, the amount of corn starch was just right. Small restaurant. Cute decor. Food is on a pricier side, but this is a niche market, so I respect that. But I still think there's room for a price decrease,  considering the portion size is also on the smaller end. On a side note, y'all white folks need to stop calling and asking for egg rolls. I overheard this during my dinner there and I'm not sure if I should laugh or be mad. If you want your general tso's chicken, you can call lucky garden/golden bowl/bamboo express or whatever your go-to Chinese takeout place instead. This is not what you are looking for.",

Hot and spicy chicken: This was an awesome dish, the fried chicken equivalent of Schezuanese hot pot including the numbing spice, but it had way too may bones. Cons:Bok Choi: low on flavorStewed Chick in Musrhoom sauce: Salty, too much broth, too few noodles. Meh:Tofu with green onionsMoo shu chicken: didn't really resemble any moo shu I've ever had (no pancakes, no hoisin sauce).The other nondescript sweet and sour pork type dish.

I asked if he could just remove a $5 appetizer from our check since edamame costs $5. Shouldn't be a big deal, right? WRONG. He said he CAN NOT do that and there's nothing he can do except offer me free edamame. Too bad bc I don't want edamame we are full and ready to go. He also said the owner wasn't there so that's that. It's not a big deal since it's just $5, but the real issue at hand is the way he responded and acted towards me, the paying patron. I've been in the food service/restaurant industry for 10 years and I have never come across any manager that's UNWILLING to make a customer happy or to correct a blatant mistake such as this yelp coupon that CLEARLY STATES free appetizer. If they knew this has been an ongoing issue then it should have been fixed from the get go bc he said \"yes it been like that and it does says that but it's just for edamame\". Then he just says that's all I can do for you, rolls his eyes and walks away.  Are you even a mature adult? Literally walks away and shrugs sorry can't help you. I asked him for the check and he just ignores me. He heard me LOUD AND CLEAR that I would like the check and he just went to set up a table without acknowledging me. I don't mind NOT paying if that's how you want to be. I told the server about his rude manager and he couldn't say anything nor did he apologize for his behavior. Okay, cool. It's too bad and sad bc the food here is delicious, but you won't get a recommendation from me. Doesn't matter how good the food is when the management is horrible, game over.  BEWARE & STAY AWAY!",

Imagine my surprise when I was given a plate of fries with a few pieces of spam, probably for the best since the fries were stellar but the spam was hard. We also got the wagyu pressed sushi and I wasn't a huge fan of it, probably because we had just gotten wagyu sushi a few days prior (and I liked that one a lot) but gf really loved the sushi here (not so much at the other place). We also got ramen, I opted doe the umami dashi ramen and the best part was the marinated egg...flavor wise it packed the biggest punch. The broth was too seafoody for me. Noodles were perfect texture and the chasui was good and soft. Babe went to the Bellevue location before and kept touting how wonderful it was and how she wanted me to try it..I think in her heart, she prefers the Bellevue location. In her words, the chasui melted in her mouth. Also, the menus are different at the different locations.",

I'm used to pork belly instead of chunks of pork, but I'm going to assume that it's authentic to Hokkaido. If it's not, I would recommend the switch to pork belly instead? It just tastes so much better in my opinion.The shisito peppers were $5 on the happy hour menu and I was actually pleasantly surprised with how much they gave you. Still -- this place to me doesn't really compare to Japan. Like it's not the best Japanese food I've ever had in the states, but they do a solid job in providing great service and a cool vibe / ambience. Pricy but good service, solid food.",

    "review": "Sad to say that my experience was pretty disappointing, given the good reviews. The place has a great decor, service and atmosphere. However, they do not make up for the below average food and relatively high price.I tried two okonomiyakis and a spicy miso ramen. The okonomiyaki is 14$ each just for the dough. Any topping is extra and if you just take scallop and veggie, it'll be 20$. It tasted like a pajeon but double the price. There were a lot of ramen options but I chose the spicy miso one based on all the reviews that were raving about it. The noodles were not particularly chewy, the soup not very flavorful, and the pork very ordinary. There were plenty of noodles but not much of other ingredients. At a price (14$) higher than any ramen shop I've been to in Seattle, it was a pretty big disappointment.Tips were added to our bill because we were a group of 6, which is reasonable, but the amount was not. An automatic 20% tip exacerbates the already inflated price, and the service was good but definitely not worth that much. Seattle is full of good ramen shops, so skip this one and spend your time and money discovering the worthy ones.",

At happy hour (around $1 discount), the drinks and roughly a dozen snacks -- among them shishito peppers, smoky little pork links and fried dark-meat chicken nuggets (zangi) -- are a legitimate draw. But even more satisfying are the steaming ramen bowls, sizzling skillets of okonomiyaki and Hokkaido mainstays like \"Zin Gis Kahn,\" purported to be Japan's favorite lamb dish. The dishes were all small and delicate, beautifully plated and delicious. A little bit pricy, but it is for sure a nice treat.Zangi ($7) - 5/5. hokkaido style fried chicken. SO GOOD!! Each order is 4 pieces of fried chicken, fried to perfection - not overly oily but with a nice crunch. The seasoning is amazing, and pairs well with QP Mayo sauce!FRIED SOFT SHELL SHRIMP ($8) - 1/5. Served with Garlic Miso, Yuzu Sriracha, or QP Mayo. meh....salty and bland.ABURI WAGYU + UNI Pressed Sushi ($19) - 3/5. Only 6 tiny pieces for a steep price. Thinly sliced beef topped with a small uni, on top of rectangular sushi rice.OKONOMIYAKI with pork, large ($14+2+4) - 4/5. Good!! The okonomiyaki is like a patty, served on top on crispy noodles and some mayo. It comes in a cast iron skillet to keep the heat. Delicious, but still a small portion even though we upgraded the size.SHIO RAMEN ($14) - 4/5. Served with a slice of chashu, bamboo shoots, mizuna, roasted seaweed, and a soft boiled egg. Noodles were al dente and chewy. Soup was nice and clear. Loved the traditional accompaniments a soft-but-not-runny boiled egg.",

There is really a secret art to how they create these delicious bowls of soup that keeps me satisfied from the cold winters into the hot summers!My go-to for their ramen would have to be their Spicy Miso. I love how the broth is perfectly seasoned and the noodles have that perfect bounce. Honestly, Yoroshiku is one of the underdogs in Seattle for yummy ramen! Another dish that I enjoy getting here is their Lobster (?) Soba. I believe its available during the summertime but OMG that broth is flavorful! If you're into shrimpy-shellfish flavored soups, THIS is the one for you.The Zangi (almost like Karaage?) is also super delish and is worth getting as an appetizer. The Okonomiyaki (Japanese Savory Pancake) is also pretty good! Make sure you get it with the yakisoba noodles, you won't regret it!The pressed sushi here isn't my fave, but if that's your thing I think it's worth trying! The \"Poke Ramen\" was a hard pass for me as well.All in all, a great place to hang out and chill with yummy food! They also have a full bar and HH deals so check 'em out!",

Once we were seated, service was consistently great throughout the night with food being delivered quickly, water being refilled all night, etc. For appetizers, my friend and I had aburi shime-saba pressed sushi and beef tongue, both of which were fantastic. I loved the flavor and texture of both. As far as the entrée was concerned, I wasn't as impressed. I ordered the umami dashi ramen, and I found it to be pretty bland in flavor. My friend, on the other hand, ordered the miso ramen, which had a much richer flavor. We had planned to get the fisherman ramen (clam, octopus, sockeye salmon, scallops, and miso broth), but it was sold out for the night. Overall, good experience, but I'd like to come back and try the fisherman ramen dish since I wasn't happy with my umami dashi ramen.",

    "review": "\"We should go to Mio Posto more often...\" is what my wife said to me as we left Mamma Melina tonight. That and \"we just won't ever go back.\"We have been coming to MM regularly together since 2012, and my wife has been going there since they were on Roosevelt long before that. Tonight was the last straw. Perhaps they have changed management or been sold or something, but the food and the service have both degraded significantly over the last 18-months or so. The food was once good, and we left satisfied, and would take our leftovers home if there were any. Sadly our favorite dishes which we have ordered consistently are now rarely impressive and sometimes just bad. We often leave saying - wow that place has gone downhill. At least until tonight anyway. The last time we were at the restaurant, we sat in the bar for happy hour and our waitress berated the bus boy so badly that we felt the need to pull him aside separately and give him a cash tip and tell him we thought he was doing just fine. She blamed the fact that no one had contacted us for 10+ mins on him and trash talked him to us after he gave us water. Tonight we stopped in for dinner and were sat promptly, nobody contacted us for a solid 10 minutes, and when someone did, they apologized for the wait and took our drink orders. Another 15 mins later they brought our wine and took our dinner orders. Eventually when our food came out we had been sitting at the table for 5 mins shy of an hour and the food was warm (not hot) and my wife's bucatini was AWFUL. The meatballs were legitimately bad. My pizza was acceptable but was not cooked as well as I would have hoped, warm, but mostly undercooked. It took another 10 minutes of waiting before my wife went to the host stand to get our check. It's unfortunate, but after having eaten there consistently for years, Mamma Melina will no longer be considered when we choose a restaurant to eat dinner or to recommend to friends.",

As mentioned, the favorite was most definitely the eggplant, as it was the most flavorful and just overall surprised all of us in its taste. I was also a huge fan of the gnocchi, which was recommended by others, as the dish had the perfect gnocchi texture and the creamy sauce was absolutely delicious.

Plus when we got there, we were informed that it was happy hour until closing that night (and Saturday), so we went to sit at the bar area for the happy hour. The lighting here is quite dim giving an intimate/romantic ambience. The setup in the dining area was specially romantic with the classic chandelier and all. I really like the interior here.The service wasn't the greatest which was apparent the moment we stepped in and not greeted with the slightest smile both from the hostess and the waitress. But I did find that she was quite attentive in checking on us.We ordered Spaghetti al' ortolano which has grape tomatoes, pine nuts, big chunks of goat cheese and rucola. I don't usually care for goat cheese but this meal was enjoyable thoroughly specially with the crunch from the pine nuts as well, the flavor was very light though. We also ordered the Melina pizza which is the black truffle pizza with mushroom and mozzarella. This one is yum! The black truffle is very prominent. It reminded us with the NYC black truffle pizza that we had (that went viral before), minus the oozing egg.For drink we got X-rated Tini (mango, passionfruit liqueur with sky blood orange soda) and Plum Blossom (pearl plum vodka, lemon juice and triple sec). Both drinks were very very good. The X-rated Tini is more a citrusy refreshing cocktail, while the Plum Blossom reminds me a lot of a cotton candy type of cocktail. I was pleased with the food and drink. Probably would order their eggplant parmigiana and their risotto next time. For dessert, we were hoping to order their cannoli but the waitress told us that they hadn't made it in a long time so we got their Tiramisu. The tiramisu sadly is pretty standard. Our bill came to about $60 excluding tax. Overall, for the portion and quality, I do find the price to be overpriced. However for a quick bite late dinner, we'd probably go back here again.",

My husband had the salmon linguini and it was ok. I got happy when he told me the food that I prepare was better. So, one star from my daughter, three stars from my husband and four stars from me. I still think that the waiting time had something to do with their reviews. And yes, we had reservations  for mother's day!",

We were a bit sketched out upon seeing the 'okay' food rating by the front door, but it was late, and the all day happy hour menu beckoned. We managed to snag the last 4 bar seats around 8:30pm on a Monday, since everything else was full. The main dining room was pretty dead and we were assured by our neighbors that the food and wine deals were solid.All food on the bar menu is half off during happy hour, so we dove into the rigatoni bolognese, margherita pizza, gnocchi, focaccia, and the broccoli. They also enforce a strict one drink minimum/person for happy hour. Can't say I've ever seen that one before.Anyway, the food was tasty for the price! The pizza came out piping hot with an appropriate amount of toppings, the rigatoni was cooked al dente, and the gnocchi were light and delicious. Overall, we were pleased with our late meal, but not super pumped that we had to flag servers down to get menus, water, etc.",

The downfall was the question our waiter asked us after we ordered: \"would you like soup or salad\" with that? The way he phrased it made us feel inclined that it was an included option. He never phrased, nor hinted that it was additional cost. On top of that, the house salad was $8.50 per person! That only included some lettuce greens, carrot shavings, and a slice of beet.

Although the naan here was large, it really lacked in flavor and texture. It wasn't garlicky or buttery enough and it felt way too soft, lacking in a slight crispness I've had at other places. - When ordering the butter curry with fish, we specified 4/5 for spiciness because we love a bit of heat. However, the curry was absolutely not spicy at all. It was a 1/5. Although the taste of the curry was decent, I was really looking forward to the spice that was expected to come with it. - Prawn biryani was spicy just like we expected (yay!), but the rice was too moist and felt mushy. - It was really sweet of them to give us a complimentary dessert, but the cake was unfortunately really dry and way too sweet.",

It was so convenient to be able to simply park our car and walk in, rather than spend half of our dinner looking for parking. The restaurant itself is also deceivingly large: despite being a lively place when we went at 6pm, there was additional space and what appeared to be a banquet room as well. The staff was nice, and accommodated to our requests. Getting complimentary samosas as an appetizer and lemon cake for dessert also made us feel very taken care of, and both were delicious.And most importantly: the food! The menu had a ton of options. I ended up going with the Channa Masala, and my boyfriend went with one of the chicken dishes. We both thought the food was delicious, and appreciated that the staff were able to customize the spice-level due to our preferences. The portions were also very generous, so we got to-go containers and had leftovers the next day.And most importantly: the naan. You have GOT to try this naan.

The night started off with a decision to head to Taste of India for dinner. We were greeted pleasantly and were ushered to a table, we were seated and asked if we had any questions about the menu. Me being Indian my palate has been well accustomed to good Indian food so I always get a little nervous to eat at an Indian Restaurant for the fear that it may not deliver and oh boy was I wrong! A complimentary plate of mini samosa's with a freshly ground mint and tamarind chutney arrived! It was absolutely delicious that it got us excited for the dinner! We quickly picked- Drink: Beautifully spiced Chai Appetizer: Vegetable Cutlet, SamosaMain course: Kofta Curry, Bhindi Masala, Garlic Naan, Basmati Rice The chai arrived first- piping hot with some nostalgic aroma of Cardamom and cinnamon Next in just a few moments our appetizers arrived, the Samosas were absolutely delightful but unfortunately I didn't share the same enthusiasm about the Vegetable cutlets though the mint chutney it came with was delicious!Next, our main courses arrived liked clockwork! We had ordered spice level 5 it was perfect for us but if you cannot tolerate spice go for 3! Bhindi Masala- Basically an Okra Masala though simple - very hard to get it right but they were.. Smack on! Very delicious even when eaten with Naan or mixed with rice. Kofta Curry- very creamy, smooth, delicious and definitely leaving you wanting more of it Garlic Naan- soft, beautiful aroma of roasted garlic and melting butter. What a delight! The food was great but the service was even better! I rate any restaurant based on how they treat their customers and how attentive they are to their needs. Right from the moment we arrived to the moment we left, we were taken care of by the staff. Our water glasses were never empty, Chai was constantly refilled, our food arrived promptly, help even arrived to clear out extra plates when we had no space when all our food arrived and finally every piece of cutlery we needed were provided and even a new bottle of authentic Indian pickle was placed on the table before service! 5 stars does just about enough justice! I truly had a wonderful experience here! To wrap up, they placed a delicious Rasmalai (an Indian dessert) on our table after service and said that too was complimentary!

The small was a healthy and well-proportioned meal, but if you're really hungry for lunch, the medium is the way to go!Another unique thing about Koa is that they only offer three menu items (plus coffee and lemonade): Japanese beef or veggie curry, Portuguese sausage and egg, and Kahlua Pork with cabbage. All of the dishes are the same price. However, you can also do half and half for the same price which is a double win! I ordered half beef curry and half Portuguese sausage. The dish came with white rice and an egg cooked to my liking. The curry was very tasty, but also super mild. I pepped it up with some sriracha and hot secret sauce for the extra kick. The Portuguese sausage was okay, but I think that I would get either a full beef curry or half curry and half kahlua pork next time.Service was friendly and fast.

We had seen this place on the Ave all the time and were curious to check it out since the incredibly short hours it is open were really interesting to us.We both got the medium size curry with beef. The amount we got was quite a bit, it was a good heap of rice lathered in a really dark and hearty curry. This curry was different from your typical curry as it wasn't primarily made out of the curry blocks you can get at the grocery store. There was a LOT of diced onions, and that was honestly the dominating texture of the curry. There was a lot of pepper through the curry, and there were also the usual carrots and potatoes as well. The flavor was like a sweeter curry where the flavor was mostly those diced onions and pepper. It's definitely not what curry traditionally tastes like, but it was still a very enjoyable curry that was quite filling. There wasn't all that much beef in there and I do wish there was a bit more meat, but I would honestly still be satisfied with a vegetarian version of this.The ambience here is super chill. The space is kind of small and there isn't too much seating, but it's quite a relaxing place to eat at and the people who work there are super kind. The owner was there at the time, and he was great to just have a conversation with.Even though the hours here are kind of weird, I think this place would be great if you're looking for a place to get some takeout for lunch.

That offered an easy sign that he knew what he was doing, and then we got to eating the delicious food. The prices couldn't be beat ($9 for a heaping medium serving) and I almost cried at having to leave some of the kalua pork and Japanese curry on my plate. Definitely plan to go again, if only to enjoy those same flavors and try the Portuguese sausage and eggs that had my partner (himself a Hawaiian) feeling like he was at home in his mother's kitchen.",

For 9 dollars (10 if you want to add an egg), you can get a medium dish from a selection of Kalua pork, Japanese curry (beef or veg - veggie version is cauliflower instead of meat and vegetable stock), and Portuguese sausage and egg. Can't complain about the food for the price - very reasonable and big portions. My dish tasted great - was piled full with rice, curry, onions, potatoes, and carrots, just could have had a bit more meat.

    "review": "I visited Koa for lunch, as I heard it was the new Hawaiian spot along the Ave.  Only open for lunch 'til 2pm on weekdays, the place gets super busy, which I soon learned the moment I stepped inside.  I arrived at Koa a little after noon; and though the space is small, every seat was taken besides the small bar counter area, which is where I ended up snagging a spot.  You order at the counter and when I was waiting to do so, the owner told me that it would just be a minute to take my order.  I could tell he was a little flustered, as he was preparing orders in the small kitchen that you can see into.  Another party was also waiting for their order to be taken.  Later on I heard him tell a regular that one of his employees called out, so he had to do everything, taking orders and cooking.  But despite one person missing the action, the owner was awesome and no one waited long for their food.  He couldn't have been friendlier and more helpful.  If anything, I just felt bad for him! There are only three dishes on the menu, which come in three different sizes, and you have the option of adding an egg for a dollar.  I asked the owner if I could do a half and half medium dish of the Japanese Beef Curry and the Kalua Pork with an egg, which he allowed.  Everything is less than 10 bucks too, including the large, which is a massive size.  My medium plate was even hefty, so I didn't end up finishing it.The food was good!  While I was dining I did hear the owner mention to other customers who came in after me that the beef curry and rice were running out.  And eventually they did, forcing the shop to close early.  Get here early, especially if you want the Japanese Beef Curry, which is their most popular dish.  The beef in the curry was smaller than I expected, but it was tender.  Potatoes and carrots were larger pieces.  The curry itself was not bad, but not the best.  Oddly enough, I thought it was more on the bland side, so it's nice that every table has hot sauce.  The Kalua Pork, I thought, tasted better.  It had that smoky flavor, and pork easily shredded once I cut into it.  There was also cabbage that came with, for some nice crunch.  Plenty of steamed rice underneath the meats, soaking in the juices and an over-easy egg to top it off.  Comfort food much?Koa is a great spot for simple Hawaiian eats on a college student's budget.  I recommend getting here early, as the items run out.  It's definitely a favorite around the neighborhood, as the owner recognized frequent customers.  Love that!  I left feeling full and satisfied.",

The highlight of Chicglet is their wings so I will mostly speak to that. The wings here are fairly cheap. You get 8 wings for $9 or 12 wings for $13, that's about $1 per wing! Not bad. They have a combo for 3 extra dollars that comes with a fruit soda but it didn't look very appealing. The soy sauce and spicy flavors were pretty solid but in general the flavors here are boring. There are only 4 basic flavors (soy sauce, spicy, Parmesan and mozzarella). Wish they had more variety to the menu and more flavors on their wings like their competitor, Chi Mac. I also really enjoyed their fried rice cake. It's a unique idea that gives it a great texture. The sauce was a little too strong but still yummy. $5 for an order.Service here was mediocre. Seems to be mostly ran by college students but that doesn't mean you can't smile or at least show some friendliness! The cashier kind of sucked the life out of the place. But that didn't take away from the overall chill college vibe this place has - a bunch of students hanging out and socializing or studying.

I ordered the combo with the parsley parmesan chicken and the strawberry fruit soda.The presentation of the chicken and soda was super cute. I thought it was a unique design that stood out from anything I've seen in the past, with the chicken and fries stacked on top of the soda. The soda was good, a bit sweet but I still enjoyed it.However, my biggest issue was that the chicken was extremely oily. I wasn't able to finish the chicken and neither were my friends -- not because we were full, but because of the oiliness.It's minor, but we also had to go up directly to the counter to ask for ketchup for our fries. I feel like it would have been a lot more efficient to just have a ketchup dispenser out in the dining area.If you're looking for quality fried chicken, right now I'd be more inclined to recommend Chi Mac a bit farther up the Ave. While Chicglet has a lot of potential, unfortunately I haven't been super impressed so far.

I don't think Chicglet is even trying to win customers. No crazy signs occupying the street indicating the \"grand opening\", no opening deals, welp, the business is not even claimed on yelp as I'm writing this review. - Spicy chicken combo: Decent portion. Combo comes with a huge fruit soda. I ordered a mango soda. I like that they use real fruit in it and it's not too sweet. The design of the cup is probably the USP of this business. If they tried just a little with their marketing, I'm sure a bunch of people would want to visit just for the cup. It's very gram-worthy. We sat next to the window and people were definitely paying attention to it. Some even decided to stop by and have lunch. (Concept: what if the soda is boba instead. Take notes, Oasis.)- Soy sauce pork: Pork's quality is inconsistent. Some pieces are really dry, but some are okay. Overall, the pork itself is not marinated well. It's pretty bland inside. I wouldn't order it in the future.- Soy sauce wings: ordered it thinking we would not be full with the two above, but turns out that was not the case. Wings are cheaper than Chi Mac's, but not as flavorful. I might come back for the wings, just because it's cheaper and closer than Chi Mac.- Fries & pickles: they come with the order. I'm not a fan. Fries are not crispy and some are even hollow. I just don't like pickles, and I don't see the point of having them with those fried chickens. Would rather have Korean pickled radish instead. - Service: there's not much service involved, but people helping us were pleasant. TL;DR: cheap wings, interesting cups, good soda and chicken, not so great fries & pickles, avoid their pork.",

Both the chicken dishes were soft and tender on the insides and flavorful on the outside which we really enjoyed. I did think that the soy sauce could have been more...hmmm soy saucey?

Mango fruit soda was refreshing which I enjoyed so that was yummy!ENVIRONMENT: it's definitely got a snack vibe feel. I love the paintings on the wall.

It also came with some chips, which were good too. The soda was rigs under the chicken, and it was refreshing. There were cute  pig and chicken drawing on the wall, which were perfect for photo shooting. Nice service:)",

The food itself was so-so as others have mentioned. My family ordered the spicy and soy sauce wings. As well as the chicken salad, fried dumplings, milky fruit soda and the fresh mango one. I thought there was enough crunch to the chicken but no satisfying flavor to the soy sauce wings. I liked the spicy wings but not my preference of flavor. Salad is salad but it was definitely on the bitter side and the dressing that came with it didn't help subdue/compliment the bitterness.If anything I recommend getting their fruit sodas here. It does come on the sweet side but it was really good!! Plus the size of the cup was big, it actually surprised me how much of the drink I was served.",

My gf and I went here because Chi Mac was closed and we were looking for a good substitute. We definitely could've eaten somewhere better and saved more money. We came in thinking we could order a combo meal (assuming it'd come with wings, fries, and a drink). We were wrong.. the combo meal came with just wings and a basic, custom made drink. We chose to order their peach soda which was actually pretty good. The price was a major let down tho. It cost us about or almost $20 just for  some wings and a drink. We were really hungry so we ordered fries and mozzarella sticks and this total our hill to around $40.... yeah not worth it. They're also super stingy!! I asked for ketchup and ranch and gave me 2 small sauce cups, like reaaally small. They gave me a look with attitude when I asked for more. I give this 2 stars because I think the flavor is pretty good. The custom made drink was tasty. We ordered their Parmesan and spicy wings and I think their Parmesan wings are pretty bomb. Their pricing is what makes this restaurant a one-time visit. You're not getting any value here. You can definitely take your money somewhere else, get tastier and more food, and still have some money left. Definitely not worth coming here again.",

Then you walk in another door and that's the restaurant. You order at the register and they bring you your food. We ordered beef bulgogi and japchae. The food came out fairly quickly. The bulgogi is more like a bulgogi bowl that came with rice, greens and a fried egg on top. The japchae was good, a little on the salty side but I liked the noodles and veggies.My biggest issue was their meat. It was really chewy. I didn't enjoy it in my japchae and therefore I did not eat more than one bite of the bulgogi b/c of it. I don't know, they are still new so maybe working out those kinks. For fast and cheap and on a Sunday it worked. I would maybe give them another shot but a little hard b/c there are so many places on the ave to eat these days! Service was friendly tho!",

I added more vinegar which I usually enjoy, but even that didn't help. The noodles were nice and chewy though. Marinated Beef with Chili Sauce $8.75: This is a cold dish. I took one bite and didn't like the texture of the beef. I couldn't get the idea of beef jello slices out of my mind. Beef Kababs with Chili and Garlic $10 (4 skewers): I haven't found (or really looked for) a skewers place in Seattle yet, but there's one spot I like back home in Fremont, CA and this just doesn't compare.

What brought me back later is that they keep updating their menu, and their new items always look interesting to me. I later tried their:paomo - it's one of the most famous Xi'an dish and you can choose the amount of soup in it as well as whether it's lamb/beef. It's a little bit more expansive than the other Xi'an place on the ave, but the portion is huge and I personally like the one here better. small hot pot -  you can have you own little hot pot with a variety of food there. It doesn't come with rice and the soup itself doesn't have much flavor in it, which for me it's okay because I can add spices and adjust the flavor by myself. ?? - I forgot how they translate it on the menu but basically it's like \"shortened noodle\" in a tomato-based soup with green beans, small cubs of potatoes and minced pork belly. I was really surprised to find it on the menu because this is only something that my aunt cook for me at home. It's so good but not famous, so lots of Xi'an restaurants don't have it at all. This is actually my favorite dish from this restaurant as it's authentic and reminds me of home.

When we questioned it, the server was like, \"this is what you ordered\"... no, we ordered 1 hot pot 1 skewer dish... we then realized the 1st order of skewers that came out were lamb and we had eaten 2 pcs already. The server said we ordered the lamb skewers and not the hot pot. Then he gave us grief cuz we ate 2 of the skewers, we thought it was the beef and he said he couldn't take back the 1/2 eaten dish. Then I told him in Chinese to take back the beef skewers then since we hadn't touched it.... he begrudgingly took back the lamb skewers, placed the correct order for the hot pot, served the hot pot and never came back to our table again. Anyways, service was bad. The food was just ok. It wasn't bad. It wasn't, \"OMG I need to drag my bf here\" good either. The beef skewers with the roasted garlic was my favorite.",

    "review": "Taste of Xi'an was a disappointment for me. Maybe I ordered the wrong things but my experience was subpar. I wasn't too hungry when I went so I just decided to share the lamb skewers with a friend. The price has gone up compared to the info on Yelp and the menu can be misleading with what you're getting. For instance, my friend ordered the chicken wings for around $4. The picture displays four wings but you only get two, and while my friend thought they were pretty tasty, $2 for a regular sized chicken wing is quite overpriced. In general, the menu was difficult to understand: prices aren't listed with the food photos and it's hard to find quantity and price listings that correspond with the photos .The lamb skewers were smaller than I expected (they look bigger in my pic probably because I piled them all together), $1 a skewer (10 for $10). True to Xi'an cooking, the lamb is cumin-heavy, which I enjoy. But again, the menu shows two different pictures of lamb skewers without labels to distinguish which is which! Overall, I felt that the food quality was okay, but I won't be coming back here again because of the prices and confusing menu.",

How awesome is that?! I also forgot to mention the first time around what a bargain all of their menu prices are - noodle dishes run about $9 each and curries are similarly priced. What a steal for food that is this delicious! ***Original review:I asked my Seattle friends for affordable Thai restaurant recommendations, and Amazing Thai was the frontrunner by far. It did not disappoint! Though it's a small restaurant, my friend and I arrived just in time to snag their last regular table (some seats were still available at the bar) around 5:30 or so. I ordered the tofu pad see ew and my friend ordered chicken pad Thai. Both of us were impressed with the bold spicy flavor (I ordered 3/5 spicy) and generous coating of sauces on our noodle dishes. I also ordered a Thai iced tea and it was sweet, refreshing, and very reasonably priced ($2 for a large glass). The food was a little slow to arrive at our table, but it was piping hot and neither of us minded the wait. If you are in a hurry, opt for their takeout. So delicious! Can't wait to come back.",

The sauce had the 'ketchup' taste to it which I do not mind at all, but did not result in a dish that tasted particularly good or authentic (even though I believe the owners/cooks are Thai!)2. Fried rice - This was highly recommended to us but I found this dish to, again, be too wet. Flavor was good but not good enough to distract from excessive moisture/oil in the rice.3.

Slow-Cooked Pork baguette: this is the first baguette I tried there and is still my favorite! Their pesto aioli is on point and the caramelized onion balanced the flavor of slow-cooked pork really well. You can pay a little bit extra to make a combo, choosing from either salad or soup, but they give you lots of veggies inside the baguette anyways.Honey-Cured baguette: Lots of my friend likes it but I personally think it's only okay. The sweetness from apricot jam goes well with the savory ham, but it's the exact flavor as I imagined from the ingredients list on the menu, so I was not amazed. Grass-Fed Ground Beef, Onion and Tomato Byrek : It's a filling pastry that's good for breakfast or light lunch/dinner. They put lots of stuff in it so it's pretty flavorful, and the sour cream also goes well with the byrek. Besides the yummy dishes, I also wanna say that this place is super cute. There were lots of people just coming here for photos initially as they have a cute corner that has a beautiful background for photos. I love how they put plants on almost every single table and you can tell the owner really has a good taste of design through all the details inside the restaurant.

    "review": "Came to Byrek and Baguette for a quick dinner after my workout class - be warned that during summer quarter at UW, the U District location closes early at 7 pm! (This is not listed on the restaurant website.) So, instead of enjoying my meal in this VERY cute café while listening to a great jazz playlist, I was politely asked to take my food to go since I only arrived 15 min before closing. I ordered a Mediterranean salad, since I wasn't looking to spend a lot of money and figured a byrek alone wouldn't fill me up. The good news about their takeout: salad dressings come on the side so you can control how much dressing you want! The less-good news: there was absolutely nothing special about their Mediterranean salad. I could make the exact same thing at home, and optimize my lettuce to toppings ratio in the process. They had a decent number of vegetarian options on the menu, but since most of them involved veggies I don't eat if I can help it (hello, eggplant!), I opted for a basic salad. The cashier I met was so kind and apologetic that they were about to close, so I would be open to coming back and trying something else from their menu that might have more of a wow factor.My friend ordered the slow-cooked pork baguette, and had nothing but compliments for the tender and not-overly-sweet meat, pesto aioli, and bread, which was soft on the inside but had a crunch when she first took a bite. And the fries were piping hot and delicious!",

    "review": "Probably the BEST place on the Ave for sandwiches.I've been to Byrek & Baguette at least 4 or 5 times since it opened around a month ago. Each time I've brought along friends and they've all adored it.ATMOSPHERE: Super cute and chic -- the place gives off a chill coffee shop vibe, great for both doing work and catching up with friends. The decor also makes for great pictures.SERVICE: So far has always been polite and friendly. After you order, they bring out your food to you and you bus your own table afterwards.FOOD: Out-of-this-world amazing! Disclaimer, I've only had their baguettes, but I'm so hooked on them now that it's difficult to bring myself to try anything else. The baguettes are always super soft and the ingredients are very fresh. The quantity is also excellent; sometimes the combo will last me two meals.RECOMMENDATIONS: Their chicken pesto and mediterranean avocado sandwiches are both delicious! You can't go wrong with any of the baguettes. I'd recommend getting the combo for the most bang for your buck -- it's any baguette plus a side of salad, soup, or fries for $10.95.FINAL VERDICT: Byrek & Baguette stands out as one of the highlights of typically-mediocre Ave food. It's one of the rare places that I'd recommend without hesitation.",

Very calming and soothing. No other places on the ave is like this one. I've never actually dine in or order from their proper menu. I've only gotten take outs of their fries and tiramisu. Their fries and aioli sauce is to die for. Probably the best fries you can get on the ave. I always order a small and find it a very generous potion. It can literally be my lunch or dinner. Always made fresh to order. The tiramisu is heavy in my mouth! Super light and not overly soggy. I always find myself thinking about it. For a piece, it cost $4.75 which is honestly not bad. At other places around Seattle I've seen the cost anywhere from $6-9 just for a small slice! I can vouch that this is gonna be one of the best tiramisu you'll get around the area. Bang for your buck.

Visit it for good food, nice staff, and cute plants!The interior is surprisingly spacious, super trendy, and totally Instagram/Pinterest pic-worthy. There are quite a few tables (good for groups), a side area with a comfy couch, and a big, curated section where they're selling cute office plants at affordable prices (most were around $15-22, cute pots included)! Everyone was pleasantly surprised and we all ended up bringing new green friends back to the office. Apparently, they have an independent plant person who comes in once a week to take care of them.I ordered a byrek (pronounced bee-rehk), a savory or sweet Albanian pastry that can have meat, fruit, or other fillings. I got the byrek with grass-fed ground beef, onions, and tomatoes (accompanied by plain yogurt for dipping), and a small side of their DELICIOUS homemade fries (accompanied by super tasty garlic aioli). So good! Also, note that their \"small\" side of fries is big enough to share.My coworker ordered a baguette and was happy with how soft the bread was. (No cutting up the roof of your mouth!) They also gave us a complementary orange scone, which was soft and so yummy.Everything on their menu is also VERY affordably-priced (my byrek and additional fries came out to around $7, and their baguettes are less than $9). They also have free wifi.We'll definitely be going back for more food, and definitely more plants!",

They come on clipboards, and it's so simple, but I love how they put pictures on the side. The menu options are simple, but theres several you can choose from. I wish the watermelon was in season because it looks amazing, but now I just know I'll have to come back when they're available again! I ordered the single sizes of mango ($6.25) and injeolmi ($5.45), expecting it to be a small cup size, but when they came out, the small singles were HUGE! We split two between 3 people and it was more than enough. I really like how they layer the flavoring throughout the shaved ice, instead of dumping the toppings on the surface level. That way, with each spoonful, you're getting a little bit of everything even when you're close to being finished. The mangoes tasted fresh, and the syrup wasn't too sweet. I love injeolmi because the powder and red bean compliment so well with the shaved ice. It's not for everyone, because it gives off a heartier taste, but it's a classic Korean dessert that I wish more places had. Lastly, I liked how the ice was fluffy and smooth. Some places that I've gone to for bingsu, make the ice very coarse and not fluffed well. So far, this is the best shaved ice I've had in town, and I can't wait to come back and try more of what they have to offer!",

It's not the topping nor the flavor that makes a good bingsoo, it's purely the shaved ice that makes it. The way the ice is prepared is the MOST important factor. Here, the shaved ice has a great milky flavor and silky texture that just melts in your mouth! *drooling just thinking about it again* We got the Injeolmi bingsoo, which I absolutely loved. It's topping has traditional Korean rice cake with red beans, castella and the irresistible rice cake powder. Also, we had to get the half Mango and half Strawberry to try out a fruity flavor and it truly did not disappoint. We ended up getting 4 Taiyaki (fish shaped bread dessert filled with various fillings - we got chocolate) because we were so sad after we finished our bingsoo. We would have ordered another one but 3 seemed extreme. I have been to the one in Vancouver and it was very disappointing after having this one. It was presented differently so I don't know if that threw me off or if I'm just biased.. but I couldn't help but compare it to the one in Seattle.

There was a generous amount of matcha, the strawberries were fresh and sweet, and the toppings were also nicely woven throughout the dessert and not just on top! The one thing that I would change was the mochi, which tasted much more on the savory side, almost as if it were rolled in sesame oil or something.

It didn't taste like typical Japanese taiyaki that I was used to. The texture and taste was more of a croissant dough and they simply put the filling in the middle before cooking the dough with the fish-shaped grilled. Beyond that, it wasn't anything different than the croissant itself. So, next time I'm here, I would probably skip the taiyaki and go for just the bingsoo alone.Overall, great experience.

You walk in and right your name down on the dine in list (or go straight to the register for take out) and wait for them to call your name.

Ok- next time I'd probably stick with just mango (I love strawberries- but they just don't taste the way they used to...anyone else feel me in that?). Anyway, the taiyaki was super good, too.

    "review": "The best bingsoo and taiyaki place I have ever had! In summary, I gave this place 4 stars because the flavor of their bingsoos are unique, they have a fantastic discount, and their employees are welcoming. I docked one star down because it can feel cramped.ATMOSPHEREThis place is always packed with people so it does tend to get loud and crowded. As a result, it can be hard to hear the person next to you or sit comfortably without bumping into the table next you. However, despite that, it is a very welcoming and clean space. There are plants decorated throughout. They also have big windows to let in lots of natural light but they also have white fluorescent lights which makes it perfect for taking pictures! They also have the place set up to allow customers to watch how the taiyaki is made. WHAT DID WE TRY?I've been to Snowy many times so I've had the opportunity to try quite a few items on their menu (strawberry bingsoo, watermelon, mango bingsoo, Nutella taiyaki, cheese taiyaki, and red bean taiyaki). My favorite is the watermelon bingsoo. Never have I seen someone serve bingsoo in a melon, but that is how it's done here at Snowy. The bingsoo itself is covered in a layer of melon balls with a drizzle of condensed milk. The snow itself is as soft freshly fallen snow. When you take a bite into it, it instantly melts into a sweet cream. For the taiyakis, I honestly like all of them. They are classic flavors that nobody can really hate. Their dough is pretty much like a croissant which  makes the taiyaki crunchy yet slightly gluttonous and chewy. For the filling, they are not stingy at all! I often find myself taking some of it out because it can get too sweet for me. Despite liking all their flavors, the red bean stood out to me the most because their filling has little red bean chunks in it. I personally really like it when certain foods have chunks in it because it makes it feel less processed. It also gives it a layer of depth to the filling. It also helps to not make the filling feel like mushy. CUSTOMER SERVICEBecause this place is really popular, you may expect to wait up to 30 minutes to be seated during rush hour. However, despite this, the employees are always smiling and friendly. I've even had the boss come up to ask me if everything was going fine and if I had any recommendations for the place. Initially, I was taken aback because this rarely ever happens to me. It was nice to talk to her though and it made me feel like the staff actually cares about the quality and experiences of their customers. In addition, the tables, floors, and self-bust station are kept clean which allows customers to not have to struggle when putting away their dishes. In addition, if you know someone who works there, you can get 40% off your entire order. Most places I know only offer 10%. I was big time shook, and it definitely made me want to come back more.

I love how they make them right when you order them. The bacon and cheese is a good option for something salty. The red bean was decent but not my fave. BUT the nutella one is so gooood. When it's heated up, it melts in your mouth and makes it so delectable. PRO TIP: ask to add an oreo in the nutella taiyaki (the workers will do it if they like you so be nice)",

    "review": "It is SO nice to have a great Hong Kong style cafe in the area now. Note that I have no comments about the hair salon part of this...just the cafe and restaurant. For those of you who don't know, there is this subsection of Hong Kong cuisine that is kind of European-influenced, that has a specific set of its own unique dishes, which is why you'll see things like baked creamy fish on rice or spaghetti, or spaghetti and meat sauce on a HK restaurant menu. Things like black pepper sauce chicken or pork, and the \"borscht\" soup on this menu are pretty classic of that subset of cuisine as well.Charlala has that style of food along with a lot of more \"classic\" HK cuisine items like beef chow fun and seafood fried udon, and they do both types of dishes very well. My lunch buddy and I had the creamy seafood bake on rice (which is actually a very tasty but light fried rice) and the beef chow fun, and each had one of the two types of soup: egg drop and the borscht, which is really like a mix of tomato/vegetable soup. The actual Canto for that soup is \"lo song tong\" but I have no idea what that actually translates to. Anyway, everything we had was fantastic, and we were stuffed to the brim afterward. Will definitely be back to try more things on their menu!",

We ordered a sizzling hot plate with steak and egg and pepper sauce that was quite tasty! We also ordered the garlic prawn fried spaghetti. This dish was just okayyyyyy. There were good size shrimp in it but it really wasn't fried...it was just spaghetti with shrimp in it lol a little disappointed with that one. It wasn't bad but not quite what we were expecting. The service was super friendly! Two girls helped us and they were so nice!I definitely had a better experience than I was expecting. I would love to come back to try some other dishes.

I wanted to like this establishment and try all the things. The prices were fairly priced around the $10 mark. I ordered the kimchee ramen and to my delight, it came with an egg which the menu didn't list. I started to notice some attention to detail here and there that were being missed; maybe due to the menu being so extensive? I asked the wait staff for extra noodle as I always do when ordering ramen. She advised me not to do so as I have not been there before and could just add it after I saw the meal itself. I thought it thoughtful not knowing that she was making a grave error on telling me how to eat without knowledge of both the client and management.Guess what? It came out pretty good but small. I looked for service in this empty establishment only to find out that the extra noodle AFTER ordering is much more expensive than it would have been if I had ordered it together like I wanted to. I don't understand how this mistake was not something that could be corrected by the management there and was hard coded? This told me that it was not run properly and although the menu items were everything I wanted to try and frequently visit, I won't be back here. It's all screwed up somehow where people make this kind of mistake where my potentially $11 meal with extra noodles all of a sudden became a $20 meal as they suggested I just buy another lunch item off the menu. What is that all about? Felt all sketchy and wrong. WTF people? Not a cool upsale.",

Before this place opened, I have to go to Chinatown if I craved Hong-Kong style baked spaghetti or rice, but now it's so convenient for me as this place is literally 3 mins away from my apartment. The place is cute and clean. There's a hair salon inside the room next to the dining area, but there's a wall in between so it's less awkward watching other people get haircut while eating. I tried their baked Portuguese chicken with spaghetti and it's delicious! The flavor is unique and the melted cheese on top is definitely A+. The main dish comes with a soup that you can choose from either egg drop soup or borscht with beef. I chose the egg drop one and it's decent enough as a complementary side dish. The dishes are pretty cheap in terms of their portion. Most of the stuff are $10ish and you get pretty full after finishing it. They also have lunch special options if that works for you.

My favourite dish here is BY FAR the dry pot. My to-go combo is garlic flavour, lamb and mild spiciness. Super flavourful and lots of meat and veggies. Btw, every time you ask for something higher than \"very mild,\" the waitress is going to ask you if you're sure because their definition of spicy is real spicy and she's not kidding! You've been warned.I've tried quite a few of other dishes. The puff pastry seafood soup is very tasty, but there is not much content in the soup. The backed spaghetti choices don't come with as much cheese as I would have liked. The malatang's flavour is watered down by the broth - definitely go with the dry pot if you're feeling something spicy. I love the egg drop soup, and it does come with certain dishes, so ask about that. They have a pretty great selection of desserts too!Overall, I would definitely recommend going 2 blocks out of the Ave to try it if you're craving HK food. The price is very reasonable and the service is fast. The menu is extensive so there's something for everyone. If you can't decide, GET THE DRY POT! :)",

I think they are affiliated because A+ advertises this place in their restaurant. Got the spaghetti with meat sauce once and did jot enjoy it. But its obvious you don't order spaghetti at a Chinese place; I take sole responsibility for that and will not be knocking off points for it. I always go here for the Baked Meat Sauce over rice. The portion is huge and could be shared between two people.  The meat sauce is the same as A+ Hong Kong Kitchen, but this location uses regular white rice instead of fried rice. I do prefer the fried rice, but its not a big deal considering portion size and prices. This place is also a hair studio, which is perhaps a common thing in Hong Kong. But the concept does not seem to work here, because the Hair Studio is always empty when I come in. 35 for a Mens haircut seems a tad steep, especially considering that the location is surrounded by a bunch of broke college students, but I've never tried it so I can't comment on the quality. Free parking in front of the store is a plus. I want to try other things on the menu, because the items do look good in the pictures.",

I had dinner here with 3 other friends and the place was busy! For how busy Charlala was that night, they did a pretty good job on getting food out. The only challenging part was waving down someone when we wanted to order more food or refills on water.My favorite dish here is their beef & XO sauce fried instant noodles. We inhaled this dish and had to order a 2nd plate because it was THAT good. Another favorite of mine is their lamb dry pot. I like that there is a decent amount of veggies with the lamb and this dish has a little bit of heat. If you like your food spicy you might want to ask them to up the spiciness.Other dishes we enjoyed are their chicken wings (hot and crisp) and curry fish balls. The only dish I was a bit disappointed with is the baked seafood with puff pastry. Presentation-wise, it looks so appetizing but the minute you dig your fork into it, it deflates and looks rather sad. Taste-wise, we all agree it was just ok.Overall, I had a satisfying dinner at Charlala. Despite how busy the place gets, it's a good place to bring a group of friends for a meal.",

Gotta add the white peppercorn to make it super delish!The classic baked pork chop over rice did not disappoint and not having a bone in there makes it a lot easier to eat.They unfortunately ran out of creamy sauce during our visit so we opted for curry beef instead of seafood baked rice. It was pretty good but I was still a bit sad as I couldn't substitute it for something else I wanted (lovers fried rice).The one thing that I generally like is baked ox tongue over rice which they don't offer but not surprised.

Parking wasn't too bad. The neighborhoods around have some street parking around, especially since it was an early Thursday night. When we got in, the place was already pretty packed. It's not a big place, I would highly recommend reservations as other reviewers have already mentioned. We were seated pretty quickly, and they took our jackets, which was a nice touch. We ordered from the restaurant week menu. I started with the green salad, main entree was the brisket with duck fat potatoes, and for dessert the banana bread pudding. Boyfriend got the asparagus soup, the risotto, and the banana bread pudding as well. We also decided to get the pickle tray to start. Boyfriend also got an Old Fashion while I decided on a Tequila Sunrise. The drinks were good. I'm a huge fan of tequila, and they did a good job with putting in a good amount of tequila where I could still taste it yet it wasn't overpowering. The food came out at a good time, the waiter who brought out our food knew when we were done and would quickly clear our plates and bring out our next course.The bread they brought out beforehand was good, pretty standard. The pickle tray was a little laughable. It was a small bowl of just a couple of pickle things. Really not worth it. It was a bit of a let down. The pickles were okay, nothing memorable. I liked the green salad with the chevre toast. The dressing was light, and the chevre toast paired well with the salad. My boyfriend's asparagus soup was light and springy. My brisket was good, again, pretty standard. Nothing too memorable. I wasn't a huge fan of my boyfriends risotto, but he liked it. I thought it lacked flavor although it was cooked well. We were both let down by the banana bread pudding. They didnt put enough custard all over the banana bread, so the corners were just dried out banana bread. It was crunchy and kind of ruined it for us. Service is quick and efficient. Although when we left, nobody gave us our jackets, so we just grabbed them from the coat rack with all the other coats ourselves. It's a cute, trendy place. Food was honestly just average for me. It was also pretty loud in there. We could barely hear each other over the couple's next to us first date conversation. Pair is definitely not one of my first choices.

    "review": "The food was tasty, but as others have mentioned, the portions were tiny. My major complaint is that there is large price discrepancy between the menu prices listed on yelp and their website, and what was actually on the menu today. For example, steak frites is currently listed on yelp/their website as $15, and in person it was listed as $20. This was true for many of the other items. I understand menus are subject to change, but it did give me false expectations.I ordered the Black Old Fashioned, which was a little floral-tasting for my preference. For food my husband and I ordered off the Happy Hour menu: kale salads, brisket sliders, fontina mac and cheese, patatas bravas, and the $2 olives. The best bang for your buck is the mac and cheese. It is still small but more filling and so creamy!  Potato apps are usually larger, so I would have liked the patatas bravas to be much bigger. Everything was delicious!Our banana bread pudding was a little crispy and nearly charred, as seen in my photo. Based on others' photos hopefully this is not the norm. Service was friendly and fairly fast. We did not have to wait for a table. I would appreciate if the menu prices were updated so that I can make a well informed decision about coming here again.",

She then took my name! We said \"We'll be right there! Thanks so much.\" So we threw on our jackets and made it down the street in record time. When we arrived, the lady I spoke to on the phone, who offered me this without my asking, the hostess, seated a party of 3 right in front of us and then told us there were no tables! We could wait 20plus minutes and wait for a table or have a drink at the bar! So Sorry/ not sorry! I guess. Now you're here and you can drink, Thanks so much! Why do this? When pressed she said \" Yes, I apologize. It's was my fault!\" So that's just dandy. I always mistakenly thought the sign said \"Pain\" and now that's played out for us.",

I died with a bunch of boys who enjoyed the sliders and the mac & cheese. Prepare to order lots of small plates as the portions are just that...small. It won't be an inexpensive dinner you might expect if you look at the menu, but worth it. The absolute best thing about this place though, was the Pavlova with lemon curd that I had for dessert. The desserts overall  were very very good., we pretty much ordered one of each! I would go back just for that Pavlova. Our waiter had a dry but enjoyable sense of humor.

Our waiter was so gracious and lovely and waited while we hemmed and hawwed over what we wanted to try. We got:- complementary bread (they bring this out to you without asking) - perfectly crusty and chewy- herb and cheese puffs (on happy hour) - amazing, a little dense for my liking, but the perfect carby, cheesey, bite- baby kale Caesar (on happy hour) - so good that even my friend who hates kale loves this salad. There were croutons and olives in it which were perfect complements to the homemade Caesar dressing- moules frites - giant bowl of mussels in a rich broth topped with a pile of fries. Their fries were a little oily, a little salty, a little soft, a little crunchy - just the way I like it. The waiter brought us ketchup and aioli for dipping. - the salmon special - piece of grilled salmon with vegetables and a nutty creme fraiche. A rather small portion, but holy yum. The fish was cooked perfectly.All in total after tax and a 20% tip, the 3 of us gals paid $28. For a glass of wine and all that food, amazing service, ambiance - what a great deal!!!",

I've been eyeing The BoB since it opened, and I'm thrilled to be writing a positive review for a place I can see myself returning to again and again.We ordered the steamed dumplings, budae jjigae & gamjatang. The steamed dumplings were a bit disappointing since I don't think they were homemade. They also stuck to the steamer and fell apart whenever we tried to pick them up with our chopsticks, which was a bit of a nuisance. Not a huge deal, since the real stars of the show were the entrees.Both the budae jjigae & gamjatang were SPOT ON for flavor & portion size (huge!!!). We honestly probably could have just split the gamjatang & would have been satiated. They definitely don't skimp here--the gamja tang had 3 (!!!) enormous pork pieces, which is definitely the most generous I've ever seen. We didn't receive side dishes which we found a bit odd after we finished our meal, but honestly since we were SO stuffed, it was a moot point.I do have to say that they do have some operational kinks they need to work out, but nothing egregious. The atmosphere was very awkward since the music was barely audible, causing the restaurant to be so quiet that we felt disruptive for having a conversation at a normal volume. And although the trays are a good idea presentation-wise, we ran out of table space between the appetizer and two entrees. Regardless, I'll definitely be back and would recommend if you're in the mood for some hearty soups/stews!",

The broth had a nice beef flavor and the restaurant did not skimp on any ingredients you would expect in a bowl of yukgaejang: beef (of course), egg, green onion, burdock root, mung bean sprouts, and glass noodles.  I wish there was a deeper garlic flavor and a richer beef taste, but for the Ave I'm not going to complain! It was a complete, standard yukgaejang executed to spec, not leaving any ingredient out, served very generously! The Korean spice level was real Korean spicy, which meant me sweating my face off (as it should be)!Only complaint was the banchan. The fish cake seemed a little hard and the seasoned mung bean sprouts seemed a little dated lol. The main was great, side dishes a bit mediocre. This place would easily be a 4.5-5 if the sides were as good as the main!Will be back -- I'd like to give the gamjatang a try one of these days!ASIDE: Also, this restaurant is probably the cleanest  Korean restaurant on the Ave!",

In an area that's always seeing restaurants come and go, I'm really hoping this one sticks and flourishes because we can always use more good Korean food. My boyfriend and I visited BoB during the week around 6PM and found the place empty at first. However, it quickly filled up as passerby noticed the menus on the window. BoB features staple Korean dishes from spicy tofu soup (soontofu), bibimbap and more. Asking the owner for her recommendations, we tried the:- Gamja Tang - First time trying individual sized gamja tang! The pork wasn't as \"slide off the bone\" tender as I wanted, but the broth was still flavorful and spicaaay. I appreciated that they didn't skimp and it wasn't just one pork bone, but there were a few within the soup.- LA Kalbi - The marination was actually pretty tasty - just wish it came on a hot plate to stay warm longer! +1 though for creativity on presentation, haha. Prices seem to be fairly standard for Korean food in the area - looking at the menu, soontofu (spicy tofu soup) was around $10, while the more specialty dishes like the LA Kalbi was $16. Overall, our total came out to $30+, which we thought was fairly normal. We also thought the staff working was friendly, offering a refill on the side dishes when we ran out. We're definitely planning on visiting again, as the owner had mentioned a few more of their popular dishes, like the kalgooksoo and kalbi tang.",

There's another one across the street. And many more down the Ave. (Yet they still don't have AYCE K-BBQ, but that's another story...)I visited the BoB on its second day of opening last week. By the way, the business was not even on yelp until I manually entered it yesterday and got approved today. Anyways, I was trying to see some reviews on yelp, but the server told me that they are not on yelp yet. He was very happy to provide me recommendations, and was passionate about their food. I love it. We got a Kalbitang (short rib soup) and yukgaejang (spicy beef and vegetable soup). The soup base takes 14 hours to make, and you can taste the delicacy in the soup. Generous portions. Amazing ingredients. Definitely the perfect comfort food for a rainy day in Seattle. Great service. Delicious food. I can see myself come back a lot!And just another random rant (don't take me too seriously), when your food is good, you don't need much effort to attract customers. Later this week when I walked by the BoB, the place was almost full. They were not even on Yelp yet! It's funny and a bit pathetic when other businesses try to manipulate the yelp reviews by having their employees write 5-star reviews (*cough*chiglet*cough*). Fix your food/service when yelpers here give honest bad reviews. Invite them over for a chance to make things right. It's not that hard.",

And a menu, unless redactions or conditions are listed on it, means all items are available for consumption at the time of the visit. Today, I walked away from one of my favorite Hawaiian/Japanese/Korean/Chinese restaurants in the U-District - Itadakimasu. It was after numerous instances of degrading customer service. Pro: Inexpensive, bountiful portions, a diverse menu of both Hawaiian, Japanese, Korean, and Asian menu items, a full bar featuring cocktails and local and international beer. Cons. Inept servers, pre-cooked Chicken teriyaki, slow service based on menu item ordered, the unprepared kitchen staff at the opening, overall poor attention to customer needs. Example No. 1. As a regular, I stopped in and ordered the Musubi paying careful attention to asking that it be delivered before my meal. After waiting for around 12 minutes, both my Musubi and order arrived at the same time. Upon letting them know I had specifically asked for the Musubi before my meal they protested and indicated the Musubi is made to order and the kitchen didn't pay attention to the order beyond the items. I protested but ended up paying for the Musubi. Overall, the meal was as always great while the customer service refused to take ownership of their mistake. Example No. 2. During another visit, I stopped in and was prepared to order a half order of chicken breast teriyaki. Initially, I was seated, before the server returned to the POS (point of sale) station and proceeded to answer and record an order, followed by losing themselves in their phone. After around 10 minutes of patiently waiting, it wasn't until new customers arrived that I received service. Worse still my order ended up appearing after the newly arrived customers' (who ordered regular Chicken Teriyaki). Example No. 3. Today, after walking through the door, paying careful attention both the time and the Open sign turned on, walked in and grabbed a menu before telling the server my order - a Chicken Breast Teriyaki half order. The server returned shortly after taking a two-top's order, that despite being open their grill wasn't ready for a chicken breast order. Let me be clear, they did not offer any alternative or inform me of the wait. They just stood there, apologetic but offered no reassurance. Needless to say, I'm probably not going back for a while. To be clear, the majority of my experiences have been mostly good. The teriyaki tastes fresh (albeit on occasion burnt around the edges), the Mochiko is solid, and the option to sub brown rice is great. But lately, the quality of service has been horrible associated with everything from food arriving separately to this latest setback (associated with a poorly-prepared kitchen). Also, let me reiterate that this restaurant has some of the best cost to quantity ratios of any Japanese teriyaki restaurant in the U-District. In fact, on average you receive around 13 ounces of chicken. 13!  But I'm no longer interested because the servers lack initiative or interest in providing a consistent experience with each visit.In conclusion, if you want huge portions, for a low price, but are willing to deal with a laundry list of customer service faux pas; then this is your place. As for me, I'm going to stick to somewhere else that I have continued respect for and will instead return in a few months to see if things improve.Your individual experience may vary.",

I don't know if I'll be back on my own will but it's close and friends seem to like coming here.",

Also they do have a bar inside so you can order any mixed drink. They don't have a parking lot and just street parking so especially on weekends since they're right across from Safeway, it's hard to find parking. But right by Trader Joe's there's parking.",

Not overly busy (at least when we visited on a hot Saturday). Relaxing tunes in the background.Service: be seated and a server will take your order. Sides come out first. Entrees come shortly after. Check brought to table.Half Order Chicken Katsu: oh man! SO glad I got the half order. The proportions are HUGE! The server said the the chicken Katsu entree is usually shared between two people. I'm glad I got the half order--I could barely finish it! The chicken was slightly chewy but there was more meat than breading which is a plus.French Fries: lightly salted and sprinkled with nori flakes. Soft on the inside and lightly crisp on the outside. I like the fact that they are not overly grease-soaked. They come piping hot! The bowl may look small but trust me, you need to share in order to have room for the other part of your meal.Loco Moco: the burger is so tender and juicy! Nice flavor and not too salty. Eggs are super soft and runny--mix them in with the gravy and rice!Miso Soup: slightly watered down in flavor compared to most places. Green onions were fresh and crisp at least.Side Salad: consists of carrots and ice burg lettuce. The lettuce was room temperature so it wasn't as \"refreshingly crisp\" as I had anticipated. The dressing has a nice sweetness and a tang to it. There's also a hint of pepper.",

Everything was polished and new; clean and organized. I appreciated that a lot. Sadly, all that effort was broken by the smell of cheap cleaning materials. It filled the place up without any ventilation in sight. It downgraded all that visual to hole in the wall TJ style. I also had concerns that I was going to get out of there marinated in that smell too.The price. The prices were everywhere. Expensive for some things and every reasonable for other things. Pick and chose your own adventure and one may get out of there with a great deal.The meal. It was the first time I ever had a Kimchee soup without ANY side dishes. Korean food with no panchan? It just didn't feel right. The soup was simple which I like. Spam was a treat since I'm from Hawaii and I love spam. Unfortunately, towards the end of the bowl, my body couldn't take any more salt. It seems that the Spam made the entire dish too salty at the end of the day. This place has lots of potential. I loved that it staged another world once I entered. Perhaps it is a better place to visit after hours.",

I love how they don't have many tables, the owner chats with every table. They are readily available for wine and food suggestions. They were very accommodating when some of our party was late. Because I reserved for a birthday they asked me my husbands name and sang a birthday song for him along with their complimentary tiramisu( very tasty!)The food is as good as the service if not better. We tried their Pomodoro con Aceto Balsamico, Pulpo a Feira (octopus) and Ravioli de Hummus y Trufa (hummus ravioli) as appetizers. The hummus ravioli was my least favorite but still good. Because I went with a large group I got to try a lot of their entrees. My favorite was the crab linguine and the gnocchi. The pasta was perfectly cooked, gnocchi was soft pillowy and the sauces were amazing. My linguine came with a lot of crab! The owner offered us his special habanero olive oil which a majority of my party tried and loved! He was very attentive and was very helpful with wine suggestions.Don't miss this place!

It's a smaller restaurant that has a very intimate vibe with dim lighting and a partially open kitchen. To start we shared two tapas: the ravioli with hummus and truffle, and the calamari. Of the two, I preferred the calamari. The squid tasted fresh and it was sautéed squid rather than breaded and deep fried squid, which was a pleasant change. In comparison the ravioli was a bit too rich and heavy. For my entree I opted for the paella and I was happy with my choice! The amount of seafood was abundant and the presentation was pretty. I also enjoyed the seasonings and it was cooked well. The only suggestion I would have would be to get a bit more of a crispy layer in the skillet. The rice seemed like it was cooked into a larger batch and then served in the skillet they brought me, so I was missing the slightly crunchy and smoky bits I love in paella. After a while, the texture can be a bit one-note without them.",

The restaurant is super cute, small, and intimate, good thing we had a reservation. Food is great, my angel hair pasta just melts in my mouth. I ordered no shrimp because I don't eat seafood and they offered to replace it with mushrooms, wasn't even expecting a replacement. Everybody's food looked so good too, it was freshly made as you can see the hot steam coming in the air while everybody is eating. Service was excellent considering we did came in a large group. They even came outside to take a group photo for us which you already know, it's time consuming when it's all girls xDThere's unlimited bread as appetizers, be careful or you might actually get too full before your entree comes out.

The paella was really good and came with a good variety of seafood (calamari, mussels, shrimp) and wasn't overly greasy. The capellini was delicious! I loved the crab meat and truffle oil.

    "review": "My dining experience at Pomodoro was as a part of a large-party. For those interested in making a large party reservation, they will typically require you to book a time earlier than their normal dinner hours and charge a late/overtime fee if your group shows up late or stays beyond the allocated time. The service was very friendly throughout the evening and as they were prepared for our party, servers were very prompt as well. They quickly took everyone's individual pasta orders as they sat down and served the caesar salad shortly after. The dressing on the caesar was very flavorful and was not too salty or heavy. It did seem like the lettuce had been sitting in the dressing for a while though-- this might not be an issue with a regular dining experience.  I ordered the Penne alla Vodka, which I believe was the best dish out of the pre-selected options we were given. It was the perfect balance between creamy and tangy. There could've been a bit more sausage or veggies to mix up the texture though. I also had a bite of the Sun Dried Tomato Pesto con Linguine pasta, which was alright, but felt like it was missing a certain 'oomph'. Perhaps some extra spice or citrus (lemon squeeze?) would really brighten it up. The prawns served with the dish were very plump and fresh though! The tiramisu was average-- we did notice that each piece seemed to have a different flavor profile (more chocolatey, more alcoholic, more coffee) so there was a lack of consistency but the taste was fine.",

I always get the same entree, the chicken breast with gorgonzola sauce and pasta with red sauce. It's absolutely amazing! Chicken is tender and juicy. I always have a hard time deciding if I want a creamy white sauce or a zesty tomato sauce and I love this dish because I get the best of both worlds. The chicken is covered in a creamy gorgonzola and the pasta is in a light tomato sauce. Portion size is very generous. They also have a house made chili oil that you can ask for on your pasta. It's too spicy for me, but if you love some heat I recommend. I have also ordered the carbonara, which I recommend. I also highly recommend the tiramisu.  Definitely one of my favorite Italian restaurants in the city! There is also a free covered parking garage that is super convenient.",

    "review": "I am giving this restaurant five stars despite a couple of unsettling experiences with our waiter. The food is just that good.My husband took me out to dinner at Pomodoro last night to celebrate my birthday. It is a lovely little restaurant, with creative lighting (red circle lights, tiny twinkling white lights, and warm yellowish-white lights), and crisp white tablecloths.I had the tomato cream soup, the paella, and I split the dungeness crab linguine with my husband. My husband also had the pork pancetta. My husband is characteristially very unenthusiastic, so when I asked him how his food was and he said \"good\" (he says \"okay\" 95%+ of the time that I ask him this question), I knew that the food was an unusually special experience for him, too! My food was absolutely outstanding, probably among the top ten meals I've ever eaten. The chef had a lovely long blurb included in the menu about his love for cooking, a few of his famous customers, and his experience as a chef. While I enjoyed reading this blurb, I definitely judged the food on my actual experience of eating it, which was heavenly.We also ordered a bottle of the Cava Mont Marcal wine. I enthusiastically recommend this wine. It was outstanding.Our waiter has a very genteel manner, but his memory and attentiveness are unfortunately severely lacking. We arrived fairly late, just after 9pm, and perhaps he'd had a long and busy night before we arrived. He also appeared to be pushing 90 years old.He smiled a lot and he seemed like he was trying his best, but he basically ignored us for the middle half of our meal. My husband had to literally get up out of his chair three times to go up to him when we needed something. He was just in his own world (also I think partially closing the restaurant, but we just couldn't get his attention for several minutes on end after several tries). He was respectful and sweet when he did get to us, however, he also brought up four very serious and upsetting topics (communism, genocide, global warming, and immigration), all of which I deeply care about, however, I would prefer very much to focus on lighter, more pleasant conversational topics while eating a celebratory birthday dinner. It was an odd experience - I must say I've actually never had a waiter bring up such topics when dining out.At the start of our meal, I informed the waiter that I am gluten-free due to a serious medical condition which gluten can aggravate terribly. I was happy to see that there are gluten-free options for many of the dishes, which I requested. He seemed to really listen to that, which is important to me, and I did not flare with my condition after eating my meal.However, at the end of the night, he brought me out a surprise piece of tiramisu with a flaming birthday candle on it. He had a huge smile on his face and he looked so excited, and I was delighted! However, when he put the piece of tiramisu in front of me I had a scared feeling for a second and asked him, \"Is this gluten-free?\" He said, \"No.\" I said, \"I can't eat it then, can you please take it away?\" He said, \"I'm sorry, I didn't know.\" I said, \"Yes, you did know, because I told you at the beginning of the meal that I am gluten-free due to a serious medical condition.\" He said again, \"I'm sorry, I didn't know.\" To be honest, the apology seemed genuine. He seems like a nice person. But it's a little scary that he completely forgot something that could have caused me serious pain.But then he said, \"well, your husband can eat it then.\" I said, \"My husband will not be eating birthday cake in front of me on my birthday that I am not able to eat.\" He offered me Spumoni or coffee on the house. I declined.I feel like he was really trying to make things right, I think he just wasn't getting it. I got upset and asked my husband to pay for our meals and asked my husband to leave a 20% tip to be polite (I usually tip between 23% - 27%). I left the restaurant and waited for my husband in the car while he paid. I feel like the waiter does embody the spirit of service that I look for when I dine out, despite t",

Though it was pricey, there was a good amount of crab. I believe it also had some black truffles which added great flavor to the simple butter garlic sauce. They also offer a spicy sauce to drizzle on top and I would highly recommend it. It is a bit spicy so maybe ask to try a little on the side first. For dessert I got the creme brûlée. This is perhaps one of my favorite dessert dishes so I couldn't resist. I was somewhat disappointed. Instead of the creamy center it usually has, this one was much firmer. The flavor was good but the texture was certainly off. The top tasted like a toasted marshmallow which, again, is not quite what one typically looks for in a creme brûlée. But it was good and I ate it up. However for $9 it is definitely not worth the price. Service here is really good. The owner is very friendly and chatted to me a little about my trip to Seattle. Other employees were very efficient and friendly as well. The check did feel a little rushed at the end but otherwise the service was great!If you're looking for somewhere to go for a special occasion this would be a really good option.

The snow crab pasta is also exceptionally good. I need to get this one again. If only I could eat pasta everyday.",

I ordered olives to start to have with their bread (which tasted like it was from Fred Meyer) and the olives were just okay. Too much raw garlic and the olives were pitted, but soggy and too tender. Maybe people like olives this way and I'm just not aware of it? I want to add that I work in a high end Spanish tapas bar myself, so I am a bit critical. The butter with the bread was nice, but I don't eat dairy, so just a taste for me. The pasta portions were massive, easily for 2-3 people to share, so the 20+ dollar price tag wasn't nearly as shocking. My pasta was cooked well, and one of the only options that could be done without dairy. If you're vegan, I'm not sure what you would be able to eat here and feel fulfilled with the price tag. Wine selection was disappointing. Staff was friendly and attentive. Also, paella is not \"risotto.\"",

We also got the Veal Pasta which was also good, but our favorite was the crab pasta.For Dessert, the Tiramisu is by far the best.  It just melts in your mouth and is very cold.  It is like eating a chocolate Mousse and is covered in chocolate powder.  A perfect end to a perfect meal.",

They fit a lot of tables in the space and you have to be super careful while getting in/out of your seat to not bump into the tables next to you.For SRW, mkt. does \"for the table\" appetizers, meaning everyone at your table gets a small individual portion of each option. I love this idea because there is no decision-making and no possibility of order regret (the worst). Each appetizer was tasty and was brought out at a nice pace. For the entree, I chose the steak which was cooked perfectly and the tempura-style fried mushrooms that came with were really yummy. I chose the chocolate panna cotta for dessert, which I liked despite not being a huge sweets person. I also have to commend the service.

We ordered the Sea Wolf Bakery Bread, Pan Seared Halibut, Grilled Black Peppercorn Wagyu Beef, campanelle, and the special of the day, duck breast. The portions were not huge but the quality was outstanding. I will comment that the duck & the wagyu was a bit undercooked, and this is coming from a person who likes his steaks rare, they were borderline blue. Sea Wolf Bakery Bread - Great stuff, came with honey rosemary fenel butterPan Seared Halibut - Perfectly seared on the outside (blackened but not burnt) with the fish being tender and debonedGrilled Black Peppercorn Wagyu Beef - Cooked a bit too rare (was not asked for how well done we wanted it) and even though the flavor was great, i couldnt tell it was wagyu.Campanelle - Fantastic pasta with a great light flavor& balance. The pasta was perfectly el dente, and you can tell that its handmade pasta, lots of good bounce to the dishDuck - the daily special was served over a bed of polenta and even though the duck was pretty rare, the flavor was exceptional.

For SRW, we got to share 5 appetizers for the table and pick our individual entree + dessert. *BurrataIt had soft and creamy texture, love it! The sweet apple went really well with the cheese. The only downside was the grilled crostini. They were hard as rock and too dry. *Tomato SoupServed in a shot glass. Bold and refreshing flavor!*Baby LettucesServed with red wine vinaigrette but honestly tasted just like any regular salad.*Beef TartareSubtly seasoned and you can smell the aromatic bone marrow aioli permeated the beef tartare. Yum! Shame that the grilled crostini pieces were burnt, hard, and dry just like those served with the burrata.*Grilled Green BeansOur favorite appetizer! While they were only seasoned with salt and lemon, they were surprisingly addicting! Also love the sweet and smoky aftertaste! We were also told that they were meant to be \"finger food.\" Think of them as a healthier version of fries! *Grilled Coho SalmonThe salmon was mediocre and tasted like something you can whip up at home. The salsa verde was a good choice to enhance the flavor but I wasn't sure about the smoked turnip since it was quite bitter. *Pork Chuck LoinThe chuck loin was seasoned properly and that red wine sauce was good. The braised reddish vegetable (not sure what it was) added slight sweetness to the overall taste. Love it! *Pear ChiboustThe consistency resembles those of custards. The chiboust alone was remarkable but we both thought they put too much caramel sauce, making it a tad too sweet to enjoy. We could also taste cinnamon and ginger from the sauce which I wasn't a fan of. If you despise those two things, it might be something to watch for.Overall, some dishes were scrumptious and some were mediocre. The service was a bit spotty with one server was more attentive, friendlier, and less awkward than the other. Personally I wouldn't go back but this is one of those restaurants that you have to try at least once. Will be looking into other Ethan Stowell restaurants.",

But if you're hungry, being cramped on a table with other people doesn't really phase you too much. We ordered the burrata to start and shared the corn and ricotta ravioli, as well as the wagyu beef with fingerling potatoes. The burrata was delicious and very refreshing with the mint. I'm not super huge on a lot of mint on my food, but this was very tasty! The corn ricotta ravioli was also very good. It came with six ravioli and lobster mushrooms. It was light, flavorful, and definitely something I would order again. The wagyu beef was alright. For $35, I was hoping that the meat wasn't going to be as overdone as it was and not have gristle. Having to saw at the gristle and sift through parts of my meat isn't very enjoyable. But the fingerling potatoes were cooked very well. It was a little too peppery for me, but that's just my personal preference with foods being a little too spicy. If you like some kick, you'd probably enjoy this dish.

Made a reservation - definitely necessary because it's packed and a smaller interior. We got seats by the chef so we had a glimpse into the kitchen - front row seats to some yummy cooking! During restaurant week, we could choose two items each from the appetizer and main course section and a dessert. You're encouraged to dine family style and share. My partner and I decided to share one appetizer and three pastas. All of the options looked so good so it took us a while to make this decision. We ordered the English Pea and Mint Burrata - if you've been to one of Ethan Stowells restaurants you'll know the burrata is AMAZING. This was a seasonal combo- and delicious. I've never known English peas and mint to taste so good together. We ate every last bit up and even got extra crostini to finish it up. I would go back for this burrata.The first pasta we got was the Rigatoni w/ Pork Cheek and Snap Peas. Basically we saw pork cheek and knew we had to have it. This ended up being our favorite of the night. It's beautifully cooked, and snap peas are such a lovely addition. Per usual, the pork cheek was so soft and melts in your mouth. SO. GOOD. Would 100% come back for this, and I have a new found respect for snap peas in pasta.Next we got the Gnocchi with Pork Shoulder. I personally love all gnocchi's I've ever gotten at an Ethan Stowell so naturally I had to order this one. It didn't disappoint. Gnocchi were so light and pillowy. Our last pasta was the Paperdelle with Dungeness Crab. I didn't love this as much as I thought - maybe because it came out after the heavier dishes. It was a very light dish with a good serving of crab. I think next time I would definitely get the other pastas, and try something else instead of this (we were initially between this pasta and the truffle ravioli). We typically don't order dessert, but for restaurant week, it comes with your meal. We were pleasantly surprised and pleased with how thoughtful the desserts were here. We got the Seasonal Sorbet with Shortbread Cookie (Coconut and Lemon Sorbet) and the Chocolate Ganache Cake. The sorbet was delicious. Overall - awesome experience. I can't wait to come back and try more food here. This may be my new favorite of the ESRs, but I'll have to come back a few more times to really know ;-).",

This place is worth checking out. I had an incredible experience. It is the smallest restaurant I have ever seen in my entire life, so BE SURE TO MAKE A RESERVATION!!! I dropped in as a first-timer for Restaurant Week 2018 and... OMG!!! I was seriously so impressed by this place!! It was a fairly casual dining experience, my girl friend felt overdressed. The food was Fn AMAZING!! The service was so good!! Knowledgeable waitresses. This place is a must for SRW!! I swear they just kept bringing food out to us. I was stuffed when I left, almost in pain! LOL. Definitely going back to try more menu items. We both ordered the 3-course SRW. They brought out about 8 small courses prior to our entree. My thoughts:APPETIZERS:-Tomato soup shot - This was a tiny little portion, but it was a delicious treat! -Green beans in a cup - I don't know what they did to these beans, but they are by far the best green beans I have ever tasted, and I eat a lot of green beans. They were so well made! Crisp and citrusy! Try them! -Beef tartare - I love beef tartare, but honestly this was a bit bland. I think its the only thing we ate that didn't completely floor me. Portion size was good. I'd eat it again, but I did feel like it was missing something. -Roasted Beets - Also delicious! Hazelnut crumble and greens served with them.-Burrata - I had never tried burrata before so I was really excited for this and it definitely exceeded my expectations. Soft cheese served with fruit and spread over crustini. To die for!-Green Salad - It was typical. Also served citrusy. Basic. A little boring, but good for the gut. -I forgot the other 2 things she brought out. I mean the food just kept coming and coming! ENTREES:-Pork - This was really good! The sauce and crispy-whatever was on the top. Served with some type of pureed root vegetable. Holy Moly! Yumm! Tender. Juicy. Delicious.-Coho Salmon - This is a 10-star piece of fish! The skin was crispy and the salmon just fell apart when you stick your fork into it. It was the juiciest most delicious salmon I have ever eaten and I eat a ton of salmon. Damn! Sooo good! The sauce and sides too.DESSERT:-Berry Sorbet - I was so full I didn't even need this but of course i ate it anyway. It was juicy and refreshing. Really good. I couldn't even eat my cookie because I was so full of food. -Apple Al a mode - I didn't try this, but it looked really good. I'm definitely going back to MKT and trying other Ethan Stowell Restaurants! I highly recommend this place especially for SRW. I got the most value for my money here and everything was beautifully plated and just scrumptious. I ordered one glass of wine and the waitress brought me an extra half glass be cause she said she wanted to finish out the bottle. This experience was #winning!!!!!! I'd give it 10 stars if I could!!",

Intrigued by the posted Seattle Restaurant Week (SRW) offerings, I called at 550pm for a solo reservation and got seated (=shoehorned in) at 620pm in between two couples at the front window counter.Three courses for $33, plus tax and automatic 20% gratuity added in, where there are 19 choices to select from for the starter and dinner entree. Great variety!I looked at their SRW menu online, so I was able to place my entire order pronto to the wait person. Unlike JuneBaby, where it is frequently condusive to strike up a conversation with total strangers. Definitely felt the notorious Seattle freeze here.Whatever, I'm anticipating the food, being warm (kept my coat on), and out of the squall I had just driven in. View, unfortunately, was of a telephone pole blocking Mr. Maximo's condo complex. No slouching here, as I kept being nudged or brushed upon with this teeny tiny space. Definitely not the place for sumo wrestlers to casually dine...besides that's better suited for Kisaku across the street, another Tangletown SRW favorite.No idle chit chat or lingering over a cocktail (stuck with water), I received my well paced courses in good time.First course was the fresh, creamy burrata with copious English peas and mint puree. Because of my recent dental mishap, I broke off pieces of crostini eating it very carefully. Definitely, the bright flavors epitomized spring on a plate. Seasonally sublime!Second course was totally spot on...ribbons of fresh al dente paparadelle with sliced asparagus, generous Dungeness crab, taken to the next level flavor wise with lemon and thyme. Made me think of my late dad, who prepared mass quantities of sweet, tender Dungeness crab when I was growing up. I liked checking the crab pots we'd hoist from the pier. My brother shared his Puget Sound catch a few years back...simply the best! We are blessed in the Pacific Northwest.Dessert had a simple presentation, but was packed full of flavor, the dense amaretto and ganache chocolate cake atop creme anglaise (or as the menu referred to as Madagascar vanilla bean custard). Excellent quality ingredients and preparation nailed the exclamation point to this evening's meal. Sure, I'd prefer dining with others for the company and conversation. But solo allows for absolute focus and unobtrusive service. Fantastic meal that uplifted my tired, borderline hangry demeanor. SRW at mkt. was outstanding and definitely highly recommended!",

In the end, we decided to order the Curry Hummus with Naan, Watermelon w/ Gorgonzola Cheese, Bulgogi Pincho, Jamon Pincho, Cured Salmon Pincho, and Tuna Tartare.Everything tasted delicious! I love cream cheese with my sushi so the Cured Salmon Pincho was my favorite Pincho that we ordered. The Jamon Pincho was my least favorite - it was a little salty and hard to eat since the meat wasn't easily torn. But my favorite dish by far was the Watermelon w/ Gorgonzola Cheese. When reading it, it seems odd to pair watermelon with gorgonzola cheese, crispy prosciutto, and mint...but it somehow works.We ended our dinner with the Warm Brownie dessert (that also came with ice cream). Perfect way to end our dinner!",

Service: very friendlyFood: VERY good. We got picked out some pinchos (anchovy was the best), deviled eggs (get them, they were the best part of our meal), truffle steak (small in size but yummy), and the salmon tartar (really good but nothing special). I would say everything was 5 stars but the salmon tartar, which I would give 4 stars. It's a little hidden treasure. I would highly recommend.",

I was very pleasantly surprised by this!My husband and I wanted to go for a late dinner somewhere near Greenlake and found this place on Yelp. Again, I was skeptical about the theme but the menu sounded interesting.Favorites:Drunken Mussels - This is a generous portion of mussels in a beautiful white wine broth with lots of garlic and a bit of welcome heat from red pepper flakes. I had never had mussels with thyme but I actually quite liked that addition too because it added a fresh herb element. Wish they served it with more bread!Pork belly & bulgogi buns - Loved the pickled daikon served on top which added both a crunch and a nice acidity to balance the sweet and fatty meats served inside the bun.Deviled eggs - I love deviled eggs! I was just telling my husband that I love ordering deviled eggs at tapas restaurants because it tends to be a flavor-packed bite. And we weren't wrong! I'm not sure how frequently they change this but when we went, it had candied bacon and some jalapeno (?) pepper. It was fantastic.Could use improvement:Ricotta meatballs - The marinara sauce was a little too acidic for my liking. It had that unmistakable canned tomato acidic flavor. There isn't anything wrong with canned tomatoes but I do wish it had a better flavor. Also, I loved how fluffy the meatballs were, but missed the browning on them.Cauliflower - Don't get me wrong. We annihilated this. But! It was charred with a torch and you can taste that. Wish it was pan-seared or oven broiled instead.Despite the two dishes that were kind of meh, I enjoyed my dinner here in part because of how kind their staff is and that you can sense the kitchen is very thoughtful about each dish they serve. The prices were also pretty reasonable for a tapas restaurant and they had a variety of dish sizes which was also nice. The food is probably a 4 star (for now) but the overall experience was a 5.",

My main issue was that I just didn't get even close to full, which is a deterrent to me considering the amount spent. Happy Hour Tuesday - Friday 4 - 6 PMSaturday - Sunday 3 - 6 PMBulgogi Bun $4 and Pork Belly Bun $4 - They each came in a cute individual steamer basket, so A+ for presentation. Bulgogi Pincho $2 HH ($3 Regular): For $2-3 this is a good deal, but I would find it repetitive to order enough of these to feel full. I wanted to try it with marinated potatoes instead of the bread, but I had to leave before it came out because my parking time ran out. Jamon Pincho $8 HH ($9 Regular): I just watched the episode of Brooklyn Nine-Nine where a $6,000 Jamon Iberico was a motive for murder, so as fate would have it I was able to try some for myself soon after! While tasty, for me spending $8 on such a small item hurt my cheap soul. Watermelon with Gorgonzola Cheese $5: All the flavors worked really well together. Honey Tiramisu $8: I didn't realize this at first, but you have to crush the honeycomb in there with your spoon to get some honey. Tiramisu usually tastes the same to me at most places, which isn't necessarily a bad thing since it's a solid dessert choice. *****My Star Ratings: 1 Star - Terrible. Just thinking about it makes me angry. 2 Stars - Meh. Unlikely for me to return. 3 Stars - OK. Open to coming back, but wouldn't go out of my way to. 4 Stars - Yummy! Will definitely return if I haven't already. 5 Stars - AMAZING!!! Would plan my day or even a trip around eating here.",

I would probably not order Meatballs again as they just tasted like regular meatballs while rest of the food we tried was pretty unique. Pinchos are messy to eat, tasty nonetheless. If the bread was thinner, it would be a lot easier to eat. I was also too full because the bread, and could not order more food. They offer $10 wine flight and $8 beer flight with some great selection for the price. Me and my husband both loved the reds we had. We were prepared for slow service based on other reviews, but that wasn't our experience at all! Our sever was very attentive, always refilled water glasses. The only thing is even though we ordered a lot of food together, dishes arrived as they were ready. I personally prefer that instead of waiting till everything's ready, and then having them at different temperatures. But it would have been good if server had set that expectation.

I only mark it down a star, because the staff was slow. We were seated right away, but after that things slowed down.

We tried flagging a waiter down to order something extra, but even when 3 of them were behind the counter all of them ignored us. Eventually we were able to get someones attention and order something extra. The food was delicious and I'd definitely return to try some additional things. -Caesar salad: very beautifully presented. There was dressing at the bottom, but I think it needed a little more. -Salmon pincho: my favorite thing I had! The balsamic honey drizzle paired so well with the salmon. Really great mix of salty and a hint of sweet. -Bulgogi pincho: also really great. A little too salty but it came with a lot of meat -Muscles: perfectly salty. Didn't have too much seasoning (most of it was on outside of shell and didn't make it inside) -Anchovy pincho: I enjoyed this but the pepper was the most prominent flavor.

Whenever someone proposes going for tapas, I don't get too excited; I always feel like there's not enough food to go around and its overpriced. However Tapas Lap is a different story. Generous portions for the quality of food you're getting at a very fair price. The first time I came here was for happy hour during the snowpocalypse so it was just my party and another group or two. We sat at the bar and ordered a handful of dishes: pinchos, mussels, meatballs, olives and dessert. Everything was delicious! My favorite pincho was definitely the shrimp one. My partner loved the mussels. Besides the food tasting good, all the dishes are beautifully prepared. It's fun to watch the chef assemble the different dishes--it's clear a lot of care goes into each plate. The second time we came here during regular hours on a Friday night and ordered some of the same dishes and their baos. Again, we were impressed. And, this time the restaurant was packed.

Many of their dishes here are for sharing, so we ordered a bunch of different tapas. We ordered the following: deviled eggs, curry hummus, chicken skewer, salmon pincho, bulgogi pincho, ricotta meatballs, and tuna tartare. Here's the breakdown of what I thought per item:-Deviled eggs:It costs $2 for 1 egg so kinda expensive. The deviled egg is very tasty and I liked the addition of candied bacon to add crispness. -Curry hummus with naan: I really enjoyed this dish. The naan was nice and warm and the hummus was very flavorful. -Chicken skewer: Not what I expected, it comes in a clear bottle with smoke in it. Slightly on the dry side, since all of the sauce was near the bottom of the bottle. -Salmon pincho: I enjoyed the smoked salmon, but probably would have preferred a smaller amount of cream cheese. -Bulgogi pincho: My favorite thing here! The bulgogi was very good and I loved the garlic aioli. -Ricotta meatballs: The meatballs were very filling and flavorful. It came with crostini that tasted good with the sauce. -Tuna tartare: This was my second favorite dish. The tuna was very fresh and this also tasted good with the crostini. Overall, I enjoyed coming here and would definitely come back here. It's a great place for enjoying a drink and tapas. The place itself is also very cute inside for a date night.",

The fish was tender, the seasoning was on point, and the dipping sauce elevated the dish.As for SRW- we got the Wagyu Oshi-Sushi and Wagyu terrine as appetizers, Wagyu steak and Beef Cheek stew for our main course, and the soy sauce ice cream and fire cheesecake for dessert. All of the dishes were spectacular. I especially loved the Wagyu Oshi-Sushi, it was flavored very well and it left me wanting more! The terrine was just fine. The Wagyu steak was nicely cooked with a nice light dipping sauce on the side and the beef cheeks were tender, the sauce in this dish was amazing!

We are a group of 8 and we were easily accommodated and the service was great! So with the large group like ours, we basically had everything on the SRW menu.  Here were the best for me:- Uni Tomato- Cream fettuccine: I wanted to lick the plate. - Braised Wagyu Cheeks with Lentils: very bold flavor, and the Wagyu was melt in your mouth.  I just wished the soup was not too much so I can enjoy more of the lentils. I think that's a personal preference. - Seared Wagyu and fire cheesecake: they were yummy, but really coz they torched it. The only thing that were a little meh was the ribeye and the cocktails. The ribeye was just probably too well done for our liking - however it might've been great.  And the cocktails were just ok.  I  should've ordered my whiskey neat instead.

We went for dinner and the experience was extremely disappointing, it was so bad i had to come out of my hiatus from writing reviews.I had made reservations for 830 and we were seated around 845, a lot of people were done eating but just sitting around so we had to wait for a table to open up. The girl that led us to our seats looked stressed and annoyed and looked this way for pretty much our whole dinner. We had to ask for menus to look at and she just seemed irritated anytime we asked for anything.Most of the servers here looked like the hated their job. It was really unnerving. On top of that they charged us for the wrong table's bill which ended up being more, they fixed this but did not apologize at all and again just looked annoyed.I had not realized it was Restaurant Week and we ended up ordering everything on the restaurant week menu. The food was okay. The wagyu beef  sushi was good and its kind of awesome that they sear it for you tableside. The Bagna Cauda and Rilletes were fine but nothing special.  All the other dishes were pretty underwhelming. The steak we received was chewy, the Uni Fettuccine was okay (I've had better), and the soy sauce icecream was just too salty. The food did not make up for the appalling service, will definitely never come back or recommend.",

We spent probably 2 hours here but it didn't feel like long, the food took a bit to come out but it was well worth it, pacing was good. The chef comes out and checks on the tables and where they are at, so that was cool. Definitely got a little warm inside the restaurant. We ordered the Shishamo Fritter; didn't know what it was to be honest but I like fried things, it was a fish stuffed with eggs. This was our least favorite appetizer, it wasn't bad but it just wasn't our style. Got the Seared Wagyu Sushi; incredible, melted in your mouth! Thin sliced beef, flavorful rice, and they flame broil it on the table. The other appetizer we got was the Cesar salad; it wasn't like a basic salad. It had cheddar wisp/crips, diced sized bacon and croutons, it was over dressed and I loved it. It also comes with a soft boiled egg. As for entrees, we got the Zabuton Steak and Wagyu Bolognese Linguine. The meat was medium rare and really flavorful, I enjoyed it a lot. Had a slight chew and the smallest amount of char on the sides. Bolognese was so so so yummy! Honestly, I was full halfway through the entrees but I kept eating until there was nothing left. Price wise, it wasn't bad. I would even say it was pretty affordable for the quality we received. Definitely want to come back and try the Wagyu Four Ways!",

But we waited for our main entrees for about 20-30 minutes. Waiting for our entrees wasn't the bad part. They gave a table that came in after us our Bolognese and rice for our Ton Katsu. Realizing 5 minutes later that they gave it to the wrong table, they took the pasta from them and gave it us......The other table munched on the rice so waiter told them to keep the rice. But the restaurant didn't have enough rice for us so we had order something else for a substitute.... We got potatoes which didn't mesh well with Ton Katsu. Lastly, they tried to charge us for the potatoes even though it was a substitute for something they ran out of???Food was decent. But our first time experience here sucked. Probably won't return.",

    "review": "There are lots of mixed reviews about this place but bottom line is they do a stand up job when it comes to meat. There was a bit of a snafu with our reservation through Yelp but they corrected it with no problem. We came in and were immediately seated but it took a verrrrrrry long time to get service-even for them to come and take our drink order. We noticed a group that came in after us was served before we were so that didn't help. They appeared to have a somewhat inefficient system where they did not have a designated bartender and the servers were making all the drinks and thus our server didn't get to us for about 20-25 minutes. But when they finally did come over to say hello and take our order, the servers were personable and the food came out pretty quickly. Since we had more than enough time to look over the menu we went ahead and placed our drink, appetizer and entree orders in fear it'd be another half hour before we'd be able to order again. Drinks were pretty good but the apps were amazing. We each got an order of the seared wagyu (which comes as a pair and they sear tableside). You might think, 7 pairs of this app?! Trust me, it's very good. Next was the wagyu four ways. Again, seven orders of this app. You won't regret it and you won't want to share (about $15/person). Caesar salad was good and comes with a poached egg and the mizuna salad looks like a plate full of grass but I enjoyed it. As far as entrees, the wagyu is the way to go. All the meat is served with a roasted garlic and tomato and a perfect accoutrement to the delicious meat. I usually love ribeye most but I've got to say the wagyu they serve was much better than the ribeye. Either way, order some sort of meat. Finally, the cheesecake they serve is bomb. Their panna cotta was also a crowd favorite and the soy sauce ice cream is different but not really memorable. Oh, and $15 corkage fee! Really cool spot away from the hustle and bustle of downtown.",

Knowing that Seattle Restaurant Week was around the corner, I made a reservation for a Sunday night.I came in with fairly high expectation considering the positive reviews on Yelp.*Wagyu Beef on Onigiri Rice with Nori Cream SauceUpon reading the dish name, I knew I had to order it. Not until I had taken a bite, I realized it was a mistake. Their goal was to make crispy exterior for the onigiri rice but it was torched too long so it got burnt, making it dry and inedible. The beef slices themselves were ok but the nori sauce was bland. Definitely a failed creative attempt on a supposedly fancy dish.*Smoked Sockeye Salmon Tartare on Steamed Barley Splendid! Salmon and avocado were fresh and nicely seasoned. The barley surprisingly went well with the dish too. Recommended!*8oz American Kobe Wagyu SteakIt was decent. Some pieces were tender and some were slightly tough. They gave a dipping sauce on the side which I believe was a mixture of soy sauce and something else. Overall, wouldn't really get out of my way to order this again. The potatoes were really good though!*Grilled Scallops with Uni Cream RisottoSublime! Scallops were cooked perfectly and the risotto packed a strong aromatic umami uni flavor that would make you keep wanting more!! Highly recommended! *Fire CheesecakeTableside torched cheesecake. Tasted pretty good, light and not too sweet. *Soy Sauce Ice CreamI know, I know. You might cringe a bit after reading the name. Condiment as ice cream flavor? To my surprise, this was extremely pleasant! Initially, you'd taste the sweetness from the milk/cream which would immediately bursting into bold (but not overwhelming) savory soy sauce flavor. The sweet crumbles balanced the overall flavor. Recommended!The major pitfall of this place is the service. The host was courteous but the same couldn't be said for our server. Not even once we were asked how everything was (not to mention I didn't finish that onigiri appetizer, generally servers would at least ask why). Plates were dropped on and taken away from our table without words. Place wasn't even busy at the time. All in all, some dishes were spectacular, some were decent, one was dreadful. I'm leaning towards 3.5 stars. Had the service been better, I'd totally give 4 stars. Until then, I'll stick with 3 stars.",

Best choice made all night.The grape sour and peach sour cocktails are so delicious they are dangerous~~~At the end of our meal we didn't know if we should order dessert or not but boy thank god we did. The soy cream and matcha tasted divineeee... reminded me of my childhood.  One thing I would say is the wagyu 4 way was not worth the price. Get the other wagyu stuff it gives more. There's seating for smaller groups but you can always make reservations ahead of time to lock in a spot. I recommend calling them directly because the online reservation is not always accurate.

I probably would have given them a one star but the food overall wasn't terrible, just the service and everything else.We came here last night (Sunday night) for dinner around 6:30pm. Half the restaurant was empty including a fairly empty bar, yet there were at least a dozen people waiting to be seated. Our best assumption was that they were extremely low staffed, but how can you be so poorly staffed on a Sunday night?! They should have suggested to people that the bar was open seating at the very least. We had to check on our names multiple times to get any kind of update. When we finally got seated, no one came over to greet us or take drink orders or anything. We had to eventually flag down the host person to ask for our waiter so we can order. For food, we ordered the honey chicken wings and fresh spring rolls with shrimp and pork to share and we all got pho for entrees. I thought it was really weird that our waiter kept asking each person if they wanted tendon, and then I noticed that it's not included in any of the pho dishes and it's an add on for an additional $3.30! Which is INSANE. Who pays an extra $3.50 for tendon?! Luckily two of us said no but my friend didn't realize it was an add on and said yes cuz she thought it was already included so she felt tricked. So basically her oxtail pho was $19! The food overall was decent. The bowls of pho could have been bigger. The pho was extremely overpriced at $12.50-$15.50/bowl depending on which one you ordered. I guess this is what you get for Vietnamese fusion food. We also ordered two drinks - 1 bubble tea and 1 sparkling rose. They somehow forgot about the rose and we had to remind them after all our food came. Basically, don't come here for pho or Vietnamese food in general. There's so many better places in Seattle! (like Pho Bac sup shop)",

Our server greeted us kindly and was attentive but once our orders were taken and food served (actually by a different staff member) he was gone. Multiple times were flagged him down to bring more water but that never happened. I finally had to get up and go grab the hostess for water. Food was so-so. The Vermicelli bowls are good but pretty standard. All of the different fresh roll appetizers are pretty bland and the imperial rolls were no better than a Panda Express equivalent. The rockfish special of the night was decent. I enjoyed the cabbage salad it came with but this fish fillet was full of bones. And if I haven't enticed you enough (joking), hands down the worst meal of the night is the Garlic Crab Noodles. Did you say crab? Could you please direct me to where this said crab is?

Only 4 cards were allowed for the whole table, which made things a bit inconvenient.

Shared parking lot in the University Village, there's also garage parking. One of the surprising thing is that their food health rating is \"Need to Improve\". Makes us really wonder what's going on back there. But we've been to Ba Bar many times and never had food poisoning problems, not at this location this time either.We came here a few weeks ago on a weeknight after the first round of snowpocalypse, still the place was packed. There were about 5 other people in front of us. Hostess greeted us and asked if we minded a seat at the bar area. Husband and I were starving and agreed to the bar seating. It was one of the long high-top tables and we shared the table with a group of girlfriends already sitting there. The service at both locations are excellent. Very friendly.My husband ordered Bun Cha Ha Noi, came with grilled beef sausage, pork belly, papaya, veggies, and served with fresh herbs, lettuce and vermicelli noodles. While I got one of their specials that night, Garlic Crab Noodle. Our food took a really, really long time to come. Husband was sitting facing the kitchen area where the kitchen staff put the dishes that were ready to be sent to the tables, and he said that he saw our foods were sitting there for a good 20 minutes already. The servers obviously were super swamped and each time he walked by our table, he apologized for the delay and told us that he would give us a 10% off of our food. The food, despite delivered to our tables already room-temperature, were still really delicious. The noodles were cooked al dente, came with a few crab meat, in a soy garlic sauce. I actually really, really liked the noodle. I wish there were more crab meat in the dish. It was really delicious. Husband also enjoyed his dish thoroughly. For drink, I ordered their drink from their specials menu as well, called The Magic, served in a fun milk bottle shaped (but labeled bourbon whiskey lol). It's a little strong and I called it my adult milk drink. Husband ordered a bottle of beer. Bill came at about $56 before tips for the two of us, so I wouldn't call it cheap. But when we think of Ba Bar, they have become synonymous with \"our place with comfort food\". Specially the Seattle University's location that open super duper late (closes at 4am - yes you read that correctly). And it's become a tradition of ours for a dinner stop when we just returned to Seattle late at night from a one-day Portland road trip or after catching a red-eye flight.",

We awkwardly stood in the front and being completely ignored for few minutes. That moment I really wanted to go to Joey right next door but my friends were craving for Viet food. I wasnt that hungry at all but first impression totally suck!Finally the mustaches guy came by, didnt smile, didnt say hi, just being fcking cold and rude. I said we want to sit on the patio, he walked us there and carelessly dropped the menu without saying anything (???) You are unable to talk or something???Then another server (Jennifer) appeared, she's  running around taking care of other tables but didn't even bother to look at us or at least say \"I'll be with you in a moment\" After 5 mins being forgotten even we tried to make eyes contact, she came to take orders with an attitude that couldn't be any less friendly. Food delivered after ~ 15mins but guess what only 3 dishes instead of 4. Two of my friends order the same dish but only one was ready (?) Jennifer said they're having problem with the grill or something. It's very awkward when one person is waiting for her food while others almost finish.I still tipped her 15% but I will never ever come back. The management sucks and manager is completely a dick! I noticed our server was seem to be friendly with other tables but not us! She smiled, joking around with them but with us, her attitude was totally different. Mind you the restaurant was hella empty and we tried to be as polite as possible.

I'll admit, it is a little pricier than other Vietnamese restaurants in the Seattle area and surrounding, but it's also in the U-District Shopping area, so is argue it's kinda expected... The food: there are a lot of gluten free options here! We had the crispy imperial rolls, the pho ga (chicken & egg), spicy pork belly rotisserie. The rolls were delicious, and came with fresh and pickled veggies and dipping sauce. The pho was good, nice and homey which I really enjoyed. The spicy pork wasn't so much spicy as it was sticky, but in a good way! I'd definitely try more food here! The service: it was really great! We sat at the bar because the place was pretty full, but the bartender was very attentive, and the food was served quickly! All in all, and great visit and we'd definitely return!",

    "review": "While walking around University Village, we decided to stop by Ba Bar for lunch, especially considering that it was voted as \"Best in Washington\" for Vietnamese eats. I don't frequent Vietnamese restaurants too often, but on this particular day, I was feeling a couple symptoms of a cold, so a hot bowl of noodle soup sounded quite comforting.The ambiance is rather trendy and modern with bright pops of color that liven up the dining area. I loved the look of the yellow posts that separate the bar from the rest of the room and the vibrant teal along the side windows. We were seated promptly and handed the menu which is essentially split into four main sections - small plates, vermicelli bowls, noodle soup and rotisserie items. There was also a menu of lunch specials with several options. The rotisserie duck sounded delicious, but I ultimately opted for the Pho Tai Nam.... a traditional bowl of pho with beef brisket and eye of round steak ($12). All four of us ordered a different type of pho. While my bowl came with a generous serving of noodles, and some bean sprouts, Thai basil leaves and jalapeno on the side, I was a little disappointed with the amount of beef included.  I found just a few paper thin slices of the steak and around 5-7 square pieces of brisket. The steak was delicious, cooked to a perfect medium and therefore didn't become overdone when dunked in the soup. I just wish there was more of it. The broth was soothing for my throat, being light with a full beefy flavor. Although all four of our bowls were served hot enough, we noticed they didn't come out with as much steam as those received by the table next to us. Usually with soup, I have to allow a few minutes for it to cool, but I was able to dig in right away. Most bowls of pho are between $12-15, which is on the steeper end. Overall, I enjoyed my lunch, but it wasn't memorable enough to differentiate Ba Bar's version from a beef pho at any other typical Vietnamese restaurant.Service was friendly and we were checked on at least a couple times during our meal, which was considerate as the lunch rush began picking up around noon. I'd be willing to try this restaurant again in the future for a taste of the rotisserie items and their famous crispy Imperial Rolls. We noticed that their King County health rating was \"Needs to Improve\" at the time, which honestly deterred us from ordering anything cold, such as the vermicelli bowls. I'd be more comfortable returning once they achieve  \"Good\" at the minimum, so we could at least consider all that their menu has to offer. 3.25 stars.",

The ones in Beijing were always soft and doughy. I didn't eat crispy and flakey ones until I started visiting Shanghai and to be honest, I didn't prefer that style. They seemed dry and didn't offer enough contrast from texture of the crepe and the crunchy filling inside. One bite into a crepe at BCZhang brought me back decades to my childhood.Now I have to say that it was quite pricey and I did not like how they put lettuce inside. I had to ask them to take out the flavorless lettuce but after my adjustment, the final result tasted quite excellent.",

I normally like crepes that are flakey and crispy and these ones were doughy and soft.I didn't really think the crepes tasted that great and watching the people struggle to make it made me lose confidence in their ability to get it right anyway. While I was waiting for my order, I watched the dude butcher 3 of them and have to start over because he coudltn flip it without tearing it apart. Which is also why orders were taking a hell of a long time. My girlfriend ordered the pot stickers and they came out of a frozen bag and they didn't even manage to cook them properly as all of the pot stickers stuck to the pan and came out all ripped up. I can make and cook much better pot stickers at home. I think they need to hire people who CAN cook or at least train them to cook before they start actually cooking for customers.",

I grew up eating wheat crepes with random stuff like kimchi (not joking), but I know folks from Tianjin will never settle for anything less than green bean flour (and definitely no kimchi allowed. It's just sacrilegious to those people!)Well. No kimchi here (haha), but you wouldn't need to debate for anything else. They have all the options possible. Ham, chicken, beef, wheat, green bean, red bean flour, etc. I'm a huge fan of the spicy sauce. It's has a nice kick to it. It's pretty close to what I would usually have back in China. The store setting is a bit weird, and the packaging makes it difficult to eat without getting super messy. Honestly, tighter folding and a paper bag will do... and I definitely don't consider this as something you eat sitting down. A food truck is more than enough.",

I was so excited so my mother and I decided to try it. Upon walking in the restaurant was clean and smelled good. It is a standard size for university district spaces. Their menu is decent with multiple options. We ordered at the front and watched them make it. It was fun to watch them behind the counter. The restaurant provided utensils and even gloves to eat with your hands without soiling them. They were homey and kind in service. The crepe itself seemed good, crispy on the outside and soft and warm in the middle and the eggs were well integrated. The ham (which is what I ordered) looked good as well. However, they neglected to ask spiciness level and ours were much too spicy to consume. Thus, I would give them 4 stars. They seem to have potential but may not be my first option to eat at in the future. In summary, clean, decently priced, unique crepes, but very spicy.",

Still super tasty and I'd be interested in coming back to try different types of crepes here again. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars was because it was kind of dirty inside (tables weren't wiped down, food gunk was smeared on the cash register) and because the crepes are served with a paper lining, but the steam from the crepe plus using a knife and fork rips the lining and then the paper gets mixed up with your crepe. Also the decor still looks weirdly unfinished. Which isn't a big deal, because the food is what really matters. But the ambiance could use a little work.",

Between the two of us, we decided to get 4 dishes since we were aware that the portion size is on the smaller end.

It adds a refreshing kick. Smoked Salmon - Another yummy dish that we got that didn't disappoint. I've never had a slab of smoked salmon before (usually would get them in slices for a bagel or crack) so this was delightful since I love smoked salmon. The cream was a nice compliment to the salmon. Spring Greens - The buttermilk sauce for this was surprising refreshing, probably due to the mint. Not a fan of radishes but overall, it was a good vegetable side to have!Black Rice - Really liked this dish a lot! It's unique and was our heavy dish for the meal. It complimented the rockfish ceviche really nicely. Rice is sticky and had a bit of cream consistency to it. Soft pieces of squid and I wish I could have more of it!ENVIRONMENT:We sat outside in the patio because it was a warm day and I really liked the decor of the place. It has a modern rustic kind of look to it. Came here for happy hour which was a good choice on our part since it meant saving a bit! The prices on the menu aren't the same as the menu online (probably not updated) so just be aware of that. Portion sizes are small, so don't come in expecting a lot. In the end, my friend and I were satisfied and not bloated which was good! Will come again soon :)",

    "review": "Yum! I came in on Sunday night and had the best meal I've had in a long time. I started off with the plantain chips, which were a yummy treat and fun start. Next out was the smoked salmon, which was absolutely incredible - the fish was flavorful, warm (which was a bit of a surprise) and an amazing texture. The mussels were next and probably my favorite dish of the night- they came out smothered in an absolutely delicious sauce (full of flavor and seasoning but not very spicy) and on a piece of Seawolf sourdough toast-- delicious! Finally, we had the (skirt?) steak- also delicious, also cooked perfectly. Everything from our first cocktail to the last bite was amazing-- I've already been back once and can't wait to return again!",

Topped with sweet potato shoestrings, avocado, lime, chiliMussels on Seawolf sourdough toast - an unconventional, albeit tasty, take on mussels. Not mussels in broth, but mussels in a hearty aji amarillo served on thick-cut Sea Wolf sourdough. Good to share a bite for 2, just not what you might expect!Marinated kale salad with roasted sunchoke, dill pickle and cotija - well-dressed without being heavy, great textures. Pairs well with the Mussels toastIberico pork ribs - might be for limited run, but absolutely must get! Juicy, bursting with flavor, falling off the bone. Served on corona beans and braised greensLast but never least, dessert was a show-stopper! Sea Wolf Pain au Lait - bread pudding with apple, arbol, malt. The best ending.Loved our mezcal and bourbon cocktails, reasonably priced at $11:- Captain Hook: mezcal, rum, rhum shrubb, pineapple cilantro shrub, lemon - refreshing and tart, summer with soul. Nicely balanced on smokey mezcal- Hans Gruber: bourbon, china-china, spiced orange, lemon. Could sip this all day...the most agreeable bourbon cocktail one ever did have.Happy hour runs 4-6pm Tuesday-Sunday, $2 off house cocktails, oysters 1/2 off 4-5pm / 1/4 off 5-6pm.

The ambience is great - there's an amazing patio and a beautiful open kitchen inside. We loved sitting at the bar. Oysters: divine. So fresh and well shucked.Mixed greens: these were fine, but not great. Lacked a little salt or flavor but are still refreshing. Rockfish ceviche: I liked it, but my partner wasn't a fan. It's light and refreshing and incredibly fresh, but won't blow your socks off. Albacore: our favorite dish! A punch of flavor and texture, I would go back for this. Salmon: another yummy choice, a safe bet if you like smoked salmon. The cream balances well with it and the sweet Smokey salty sauce it comes with.",

They took us to the back to sit around an open fireplace! That area looked super cute and would be amazing to come back to experience it in the summer time. We started off the night with wine and oysters! Flavor was AMAZING - so fresh! I would recommend getting these :) Following that, our server guided us through the menu, saying that the fish and plates are on the smaller side while things from the grill were a little bigger. Everything is shared - so when it comes family style. For 4 of us, he recommended us getting 5-6 plates total. We decided on 4 plates since we wanted to get lots of ice cream afterwards (ya feel me? it was just one of those days that needed a lot of ice cream...)The menu is hard to comprehend (at least it was for me) since I didn't know what half of the ingredients were and it was hard to visualize/think about what it would taste like.We got their -Rockfish Ceviche (definitely get this) - SO fresh and well done, textures of the different components blended so well together and the flavor was phenomenal.-Mussels (definitely get this too) - its on top of sourdough that was from the bakery next door so its fresh bread and on top of it is this warm tasty sauce/gravy with mussels. also so good in flavor and memorable for sure!-Yellowfin - this one just kind of tasted like a spicy salsa-Kohlrabi salad - this was very delicious as well! you get the crunch from the pears and pistacios and the vinaigrette(?) cuts through really well too. I wish the portion for this was bigger! I felt like it was a little pricey for how much we got. But still good and would recommend haha.^four dishes will definitely not fill four people so I would recommend getting more! They do their seafood really well and they have a really cute ambiance that is also dim. They are more casual which makes it a good place to meet up with friends and catch up over a nice meal!",

The restaurant also has a great open kitchen design so you can see the chefs prepare your meals. While the food and ambiance was great, Manolin still has room to work out a few kinks.

    "review": "My experience at Manolin's was a really nice one!The interior design of the spot was really hip/pretty and I really liked the soft blue tones, which fit well with the whole seafood theme. My boyfriend and I planned on coming around 4pm because they have happy hour Tues-Sun 4-6PM, but we ended up coming a bit after 5PM. Try to go before 5PM!!! The oyster happy hour deals are 1/2 off (4-5PM) and 1/4 off (5-6PM). For the entire 4-6PM hours, it'll be $2 off fish section on the menu and $2 off house cocktails though, but still.. after tasting these oysters, you're just going to want to order more and wish they were all 1/2 off. Between the Glacier Point and the Shigoku oyster, my boyfriend and I liked the Shigoku oyster more - although not as plump, it was sweeter! Both were still delicious, though. But seriously, great happy hour - it's rare to find a restaurant (esp. a good one) that has happy hours on the weekends.Food-wise, we tried to take advantage of the $2 off fish portion of the menu, so we ordered the Rockfish Ceviche, the Albacore, and the Mussels. We really liked the Rockfish Ceviche and the Mussels - the ceviche is really refreshing, but the mussels are so meaty and come in this rich yellow sauce on sourdough bread.. it's a nice contrast between the two. The Albacore was good and unique with its coconut & mango additions, but was not up to par with the other two. We also had a \"treat yourself\" moment and also decided to pick something off the grill portion of the menu too, in which we decided on the Spanish Octopus. To be honest, we thought this dish was okay. The octopus comes out fried like tempura and it's crunchy and not bad, but it just tasted like any other tempura to me, compared to the other unique dishes full of flavor. Probably wouldn't order this one again.Overall though, we really enjoyed this restaurant. It was cute, cozy, and the food was of high quality. Not only that, but it's also near Gas Works Park (our fav scenic landmark), so if you're done eating, go continue the fun & check that place out nearby!",

We both enjoyed the plantain chips. The squid rice was surprisingly good especially since I don't seek out rice. The halibut was a bit disappointing. I think sometimes less is better and, in this case, not having the sauce would probably make this a better dish.We hit happy hour so we were able to get a few deals. Overall, I felt like the portions were pretty small for the dollar amount attached to them. Also, this place is rather small so expect a wait - we sat outside for about 20 minutes, which isn't bad, but we were also there during an off time.",

The oysters were satisfying for sure and I don't have a lot of experience with oysters to be completely honest, but I liked it (had it with the lemon and vinegar sauce)! The rockfish ceviche was SOO good and probably our favorite. The combination of flavors was light but unique for ceviche. With the sweet potato, rockfish, avocado and lime, it was BOMB. We also really liked the black rice with squid! It looked a little like a black bean patty at first and tasted a little charred but the flavors of the squid and lemon stuck out and the texture of the rice finished the dish off nicely. I'd also say that the presentation of all the dishes was A+.SERVICE (3/5)My only complaint is that the service was a touch slow on our waiter's side. We were seated in the outside patio area so maybe that's why but we had to wait for a bit to get our waters filled and for our check to be taken. ENVIRONMENT (5/5)Such a great restaurant vibe! Love that the floor plan is super open to the outdoors and that it opens out also to a standing area for Sea Wolf (? Not sure since there was an engagement party/gathering there).

    "review": "We liked Frank's and plan to come back again.White Cheddar Biscuits: I really enjoyed the biscuits (hubby thought they were just okay).  I will say, though, that I felt the ham was sort of unnecessary.  If I order this again, I will probably eat the biscuit and apple butter without the ham, and then just eat the ham slices separately.Persimmon Salad: (This item is not shown on the menu which appears on the website.)  Hubby ordered this, and he loved it; said he'll get it again next time.  I liked it too, except that I would ask for extra dressing because the salad greens they use aren't my favorite (I prefer really mild salad greens).Bibb Lettuce Wedge Salad: This has a lot of promise, but if I had my druthers, I would make some changes to this dish.  The menu says it has Green Goddess dressing, which I was looking forward to because you so rarely see that anymore.  But the dressing did not seem at all like Green Goddess to me.  It seemed a lot more like Ranch.  Also, it seems like it was made with yogurt (maybe even lowfat yogurt), which was only okay; I would've preferred it if it had been made with mayo or sour cream.  Also, the bacon was cut into big fat cubes, it was served cold so it was quite hard and chewy, and it was pretty salty, so getting a big hunk like that was overpoweringly salty and tough to chew.  I would serve the salad with somewhat smaller cubes of bacon that are still warm -- soft and unctuous -- which would be a nice counterpoint to the cold crisp lettuce, dressing and radish.Cornmeal-Fried Oysters: The oysters and the aioli were delicious.  The oysters were properly seasoned (one of my pet peeves is underseasoned dishes coming out of restaurant kitchens).  The crust was nice and crispy, but not laid on too thick, and not at all oily.  The oysters were plump and delicious.  I would get this again for sure.  I wasn't a fan of the coleslaw or the pickles, but to be fair, I'm not much of a fan of coleslaw or pickles in the first place, so I ordered the dish knowing I probably wouldn't like those items.  I will say that the pickles seemed excessively vinegary, even for a pickle.Chicken and Waffles: Hubby ordered this and loved it.  The waffles were exceptional (Belgian style: fluffy, with a really crispy crust), and the bourbon maple syrup was terrific.  The foie gras butter was the thing that sold him on this dish when he read it on the menu.  And the flavor of the butter itself was indeed exceptional, but... unfortunately, the flavor of foie gras was barely discernible, even when tasting the butter alone.  Still, the combination of the waffle, butter and syrup was divine.  The fried chicken was very good: crispy crust without being greasy, and meat that was moist, juicy, and perfectly seasoned. Mock Thai Tai: Hubs ordered this, and loved it.  I did too.  This would be particularly good on a hot summer day.Bottom line: although some of these dishes weren't perfect, they were very good overall and very enjoyable.  Enough so that we plan to return so we can try out the other menu items that sounded appealing.  We also plan to check out their sister restaurant, Pair.The place is very small, so reservations would probably be advisable on busier nights.  We were there on a Tuesday, so we lucked out, getting seated right away without a reservation.",

The order of fries was a full plate, so if you're hesitant about paying $6 for fries, don't worry, you get a gigantic portion. The lobster rolls were very good, however kind of small. My husband loved them though. We also had the banana split for dessert. The almond ice cream was the best! The service: it was great. Very attentive and helpful.

We didn't have reservations, but I was able to call ahead to check out the wait time. There was none, so we parked and hopped right in for fancy southern comfort food.LOCATIONIt's a modern restaurant with some rustic charm - there are 2 dining areas. One has booths and tables to sit in, while the other side is more like a parlor with lounge chairs and bistro tables. It might be a little difficult to come here with large groups if you don't have a reservation handy.Street parking only, which is a pain in this area. We were able to find some parking a few blocks up, but plan ahead as street parking is a little sparse during the day.FOODOyster Po Boy: I was already familiar with their fried oysters from happy hour, so I knew this would be good. They have REALLY good fried oysters, and that was reflected in this po boy. The roasted tomatoes gave it a nice sweetness that went with the remoulade. I wish the bread was a little softer on the inside as it did make it difficult to bite into. Salad was a nice break, better than french fries IMO.Chicken and Waffles: This dish is hit or miss, but this was definitely a hit. One of the better chicken and waffles in the area, it's simple comfort food. The waffles are crisp and sweet - they don't get super soggy under the maple syrup. The fried chicken was also good, crispy and moist but flavorful enough to compliment the waffles.Brisket Hash: This is comparable to a fancy steak and eggs with a side of potatoes. The brisket was very tender and flavorful, it really carried the dish with the poached eggs. Served with a side of wheat toast (you get to pick), I think this was a pretty balanced dish. I wish there was a little more brisket though...VALUEComing from the Bay Area, I'm used to paying $15+ for an entree... especially for brunch. I think for the quality it was worth. Portions might be a little smaller, but we were satisfied with our meal.OVERALLFrank's Oyster House is a fantastic brunch option if you're in the area. It's close the University of Washington, so if you're visiting I'd recommend checking this place out for brunch or even happy hour.I've been a fan of Frank's since college, and I'm glad they're still around. I used to come here as a college student for late night happy hour in the parlor - when you're a broke engineering student spending late hours in lab, sometimes your only options for dinner is late night happy hour. It's been years, but their HH food was really good back then... I imagine it's still the same!",

I was about to make the trek out to Taylor Shellfish, but once I found this place on yelp I was intrigued. Ordered:- 10 oysters (random - ended up with Seacow) + a delicious champagne-vinegar mignonette- oyster po boyOverall, very satisfied with what I got! The oysters came out on two long slabs of ice on wood planks, which was very cute and creative! The po boy's oysters were fried perfectly and I would definitely get it again! Thanks for the cute spot - I will definitely be back!",

Other notables include the shrimp and grits and believe it or not, the popcorn. Yes... the popcorn is a must get as it is topped with pancetta and chives. A perfect snack to go with their drink menu.Cons: the steak with cauliflower was a bit lack luster. I wish it was seasoned just a bit more and the cauliflower was a bit greasy. I think the cheese curdled and it made for a weird texture. The poutine was also a little under seasoned in my opinion and didn't have that ooey gooey thing that other places seem to go for. That's all my personal poutine opinion though. Overall I nice spot to stop in for drinks and snacks.",

Well, there's a reason for that....it's just not as good as Pair in all aspects.We were seated promptly, and given waters promptly. Wait service took a bit longer, and our waiter was a bit kooky--as in, sort of dancing around and joking a lot. He took our order and we waited...and waited....and waited....well, you get the point. One of the first things we ordered was deviled eggs. How long dos that take to serve, since you know they are already prepared in the back? Point is...we waited a long time for food.  Onto the food. It was meh. Small portions and a rather spendy price. Chicken was salty. Biscuits were crumbly. Pasta was lumped together/mushy and not seasoned at all. And did I mention portions were small and expensive?All in all, Pair is a better restaurant in many ways...atmosphere, service, and food--which is why you go to a restaurant. Go there instead. I don't understand the following this place has. It's really just mediocre and overpriced--like a lot of Seattle restaurants these days.",

Like if I was really hungry that day, I wouldn't have been full. The chicken was flavorless. The durian pandan sticky rice though was really rich and creamy. It had durian pieces inside. I definitely would not recommend if you do not like durian since it has a really distinct taste/smell! The to-go for it was also a small cup which was disappointing but I also understand since durian can be expensive. Parking can be rough. This place is really small but cute.

It was a warmer day when I went with a friend a couple weeks ago, so they had left the door open since there was no AC, but it was pretty annoying with all the flies inside. We ordered the chicken over rice, pad thai with duck and the mango sticky rice. The pad thai was average, nothing special and my friend thought the noodles could have been cooked a little longer. There was also not much duck in the dish as well. The chicken over rice seemed to be one of their top dishes, but it was pretty bland to me, the rice wasn't flavored but the chicken was pretty moist. The mango sticky rice was probably the best dish. Sweet mango paired with great coconut sticky rice. I might come back to try their other dessert items, but I don't recommend their food.",

I believe most things in life are better with a fried egg. No, but seriously... if you can handle the spice YOU NEED TO ORDER THE MINCED CHICKEN! It was soooo good! They give you free hot tea, and the service is good although there were only 2 people and they can get very very busy. So why 4 stars instead of 5?

The Pad Thai was good but I could only find a tiny piece of crab, so it is not \"as good as it gets\".  I give this place a lot of credit for their authenticity and for that star dish which is really awesome.

It's a small hole in the wall place in the U district with about 6-7 tables with seating along the front windows. *Warning*: you will leave smelling like food :-/ bc the kitchen is not enclosed. We ordered 6 savory items on the menu and had a couple of desserts. Here's what we had:Roti - sweet, salty, crispy, perfection! MUST ORDER THIS! Khao mung gai - poached ck, ginger + garlic sauce, broth, rice, cucumbers - SAUCE IS EVERYTHING! Perfect balance of savory, sweet, tang & spice. Broth is nice and light; perfect compliment. Ck poached beautifully; supple. Khao kai tiew - Thai omelet add crab w rice - this dish leaves a lot to be desired. Nothing unique or special. Bland. Tastes great with garlic ginger sauce though. {drizzles sauce all over life} Ka praw gai kai dao - sautéed ground chicken w/ chilies and basil. Holy damn it's SPICY AF. Tastes amazing, just a bit spicy. Over-easy egg was yolk-tastic. Green curry fish - I'm not a big curry lover. The bamboo shoots were just a little too funky for my liking. I'd pass on this one. Duck pad Thai - duck = excellent, flavor = awesome, just a touch too salty. Pro tip: eat with rice to minimize salt explosion haha #doublecarblife Coconut catfish - was a special dish that the chef made for us. Came with cilantro & basil. I love catfish so this was delish. Perfectly cooked and seasoned. Hint of curry from the coconut sauce. Touch of spice and tang. Bubble waffle w/ pandan + taro ice cream - ok this was my first experience w bubble waffles and this one is INCREDIBLE! Crispy, sweet, and perfect! NEED MOAR. Ice cream is bleh. Pandan noodles + jack fruit shaved ice - Love pandan jelly noodles. Nothing exciting. Just crunchy ice w/ coconut milk and pandan jelly w mushy jackfruit added in. Overall, I'd recommend this place. Super friendly people, delish food. It's a little cramp and you will smell like the food. If I was in the neighborhood, sure I'll drop by for togo and to grab some roti, waffles & Thai tea or something. I wouldn't make a drive all the way here to dine in with 2 babies though.

They also usually keep the front door open to air out the restaurant.Parking: 3/5 U-district parking is always tough, but it shouldn't be too hard to find parking in the surrounding area. It is mostly pay to park though.Food: 5/5 I ordered the Regular Udon Large with green onion and ginger ($8). Pumpkin tempura ($0.99), zucchini tempura ($0.69), broccoli tempura ($0.79), 2 shrimp tempura ($2.58), and salmon onigiri ($2.75). The large udon is VERY LARGE. It was more than enough food for me and I was stuffed at the very end. The noodles and broth all taste great. You can't really make a bowl of udon taste bad unless you really tried. The tempura themselves are pretty mediocre and the price can add up if you get too many. The salmon onigiri was tasty, but a little small for the price. I spent $18 total for research purposes. Next time I come here, I'lI probably just get the medium udon and a few pieces of tempura, which should make me perfectly full without breaking my bank. The portion sizes of the udon for the cost definitely makes this place worth it!Side Note: I wouldn't get anything other than the regular udon or the simple ones here. It doesn't seem like a high end place or a place that would specialize in meat. For the reviews that say they didn't like the place, I'm assuming they ordered some sort of meat and had high expectations of a place like this.Overall: 4*0.1 + 5*0.1 + 3*0.1 + 5*0.7 = 4.7",

I didn't really know what i was expecting but Apparently its kind of like a grab, pay and go kinda restaurant which is really cool--it was just not what i was expecting at a Japanese noodle shop, this was all a first for me. they price based on the bowl size so i chose the medium and then chose the noodles, broth and other toppings I'd  want like Tempura, eggs and such. Oh and me being me i asked her what kind of noodles they have and she said \"........Udon\" i was so embarrassed oh god. I swear for some reason they had more noodles other than udon i think my friend told me about it but i guess not. So I'm still in line, anxious to just take a picture of my food and go, she hands me my udon and i see these other side dishes to my right and i just start taking them because i thought they were complimentary. Guys, they're not complimentary. They cost money. And they were so much money for just a 12pm lunch. Over all i ended up spending about 20 dollars and when i told me friend about it she was disappointed in me. The staff was great, the girl was really patient with me i just got a little flustered at myself for the stupid questions i was asking. Very spacious environment, it looks like most of their customers are college student like me who just eat their food and go and so i was able to notice that the staff is really quick on cleaning the tables, getting them ready for the next customers.

Like many udon places these days, you order your udon base and customize it with add-ons such as seaweed, green onions, an egg etc. Some cost extra and some are complimentary, but everything is clearly indicated so there's no confusion. There's also a bunch of sides you can get such as tempura and chicken karaage. Those are all sold by the piece and cost $1-3 each so a few pieces can quickly add up. I got a small niku udon (sukiyaki beef) ($8.50) and added seaweed to it for $0.29. I also ordered some mushroom tempura, which was $0.99 for a stick of 4 mushrooms. It was a very satisfying lunch. The broth wasn't too salty and the noodles tasted perfectly cooked. I can see this being very popular when the weather gets cold. Overall, a good lunch spot and reasonably priced as well.",

Since I'm still staying at UWMC, I placed an order at the University location to be delivered via Uber Eats. I went with the same thing I always get-- a large cold/sauce Ontama Udon w/ ginger, wakame, and tempura flakes. I also got 3 pieces of chicken karage and 3 pieces of fried gyoza. Man was I thoroughly disappointed w/ this location. With respect to the udon, the sauce was beyond salty. It literally tasted like pure soy sauce and was so salty that it hurt my lips. Secondly, the ontama was overcooked. The yolk came apart in several large chunks as opposed to the runny yolk I am use to (and love) from the Capitol Hill location. They gave a good amount of wakame but skimped on the tempura flakes, and the grated ginger was completely missing. Most importantly, I paid for an extra ontama (a second egg) which like the ginger, was missing as well.The fried gyoza was blah. Tasted no better than the frozen gyoza I cook at home. Finally, the karage was good but look at the size of that one piece in my picture. It is half the size of the 2 other pieces and about the same size as the gyoza. WTF.Bottom line, this was a horrible experience both with the taste and service. Perhaps because it was a delivery order they thought they didn't need to try. Either way I will never order from this location again.",

It's always hard to tell with noodles and delivery because I'm never sure if they're going to keep the noodles in the sauce or separate them. However, I can rest assured that this place will always pack the food nicely! They separated the tempura flakes I requested, the sauce was separated from the noodles and I was a happy camper!This is the only kind of restaurant I've seen that has this style of U-don with the sauce and toppings. I've only had this kind of U-don in LA. I will definitely be ordering from this place again though! I suggest the U-don with beef and sauce (instead of the soup) with tempura flakes. It's sooo good, and with sizes that only vary by 50 cents. You might as well just enjoy a large!",

Is it because all the popular Seattle foodies have been posting about it all over insta and everyone else is jumping on the bandwagon or what?? Sorry but this place is OVERRATED!We came in for dinner at around 530 and the place was completely empty. There are pictures and signs all over the wall but ordering was still very confusing. We did end up getting the Ume Niku Oroshi, chicken Katsu curry U-Don and a couple of fried side dishes and sodas. I was really excited to eat but was seriously disappointed. First of all the niku U-Don (soup) was not hot, more like lukewarm and the broth lwas lacking in flavor. The meat was dried out and hard as were the U-Don noodles. The chicken katsu curry wasn't special either. The curry was very one dimensional and the chicken cutlet was overcooked and tough making it difficult to chew. The fried sides had obviously been sitting out for a long time because the tempura batter was soggy and the karage was dried out as well. Nothing here is fresh at all! Fresh noodles should be soft, slick, chewy and bouncy.  The U-Don noodles here are similar to the instant ones that you can get at an Asian market.  No joke. For two, I ended up paying close to $40 dollars for our meal. What a rip off! Not sure if we came in on an off day but our experience was extremely disappointing. So bad that we had to go for a 2nd dinner down the street.",

They have another location in town (Capitol Hill) but this one is surrounded by a plethora of restaurants on University Way. We dropped in on a Friday evening (around 6:30pm) and the place was popping. Mostly students but don't worry, there's tons of booths and even an udon bar for the solo diners.There's about 16 udon options (cold and hot) along with a few tempura and dessert. You choose from three sizes (small, medium or large). It's cafeteria style where you grab a tray, tell them your order, pick any tempura/extras you want and then pay. There's water and hot water at the drink station. Busk your own tables when you're done eating.Awesome that you can see the udon noodles being made fresh while you wait in line. Green onions, grated fresh ginger and tempura flakes are free to add into your bowl.- 2x Onion ring tempura ($0.33 US each) - these were sitting out for awhile so they weren't fresh but still tasty. It tastes better dipped in their tempura sauce.- Curry udon ($10.50 US large) - spicy Japanese curry dashi soup with beef, onions and green onions. They give you a massive amount of noodles which had a springy bite and retained a good texture the whole time. Broth is flavourful. Solid.- Tan tan udon ($10.00 US large) - topped with spicy pork, wakame and house made chili oil. I was surprised that the broth was actually spicy. Good kick to both the broth and meat. Loved the wakame for some vegetables and change in texture. Again, noodles were abundant and had a satisfying chewy bite to them.Reasonably priced, comfort food at U:Don. I'd happily come back again to get my udon fix. A place like this needs to exist back home!",

That being said, I think the staff and food easily made up for this. I asked for recommendations and the staff was happy to take me through the menu options they recommended after I told them what I've liked in the past. I topped off the beef broth with soup noodles and a variety of tempura veggies and it was exactly what I was searching for on a cold Sunday afternoon.

You can choose the size, type of noodle, broth, and any additional toppings. Once you get your noodles, you can pick additional sides like a plate of fresh tempura or a takoyaki skewer.I'm a sucker for their kitsune udon (fried tofu udon) with original dashi broth with sliced green onions and grated fresh ginger. You can add tempura flakes and seaweed for free as well! The savory broth is perfect for the rainy days - it'll keep you warm for the rest of the day. If you like Japanese curry, try their katsu curry udon - I highly recommend it!Each noodle dish is ~$10 which is really affordable considering its quality and size. I'd also recommend getting 1-2 tempura on the side because they are also affordable and yummy! The crispy tempura perfectly complements the udon broth.",

The restaurant takes reservations; I'd recommend one if you are coming at a peak dining time. But on to the food! The food is really tasty and presented very beautifully. We got the Jeon sampler (4pcs), chicken wings (5 pcs), kimchi fried rice with pork, katsu pork with curry, kimchi jjigae, and the nabe. Entrees were moderately sized, the appetizers were pretty small. Wish the apps were a little more substantial. I had the katsu and it was very crisp. Each dish had a lovingly handmade feel. The only reason I am knocking a star is because no banchan is served, which I think is crazy for a Korean place! The owners should really reconsider serving even a couple of banchan.

It was definitely on the more expensive side but it was delicious. It was more savory and flavorful than a lot of the other bibimbap's I've had. The service was relatively quick too! Everything about this place was spectacular except for one thing.. the BANCHAN was not complimentary. I was a little disappointed about this because one of the most exciting things about korean restaurants for me is the banchan. Ended up paying 5$ for a kimchi trio which honestly was just.. generic. I don't think it's a breaking factor but it keeps me from giving this place 5 stars.",

Volcano Steamed Egg3. Sweet and Spicy wings First Visit: We had a fantastic time our first time at Son of a butcher! We (group of 4) added ourselves to the Yelp waitlist 30 min before arriving, caught a seat at the bar and ordered a few drinks, and were eventually seated about 20 minutes after that. The staff is extremely busy so you have to order fast if you want your food to come out early which is understandable. Our waitress was extremely helpful in helping us choose our courses and was responsive when we needed more drinks! The food was absolutely delicious. I would suggest getting 1 beef OR pork combo then adding a meal on the side if you want to try more. Personally, our table ordered the beef combo (comes with most sides to shareand added a plate of pork belly and an extra steamed egg side. With over 5 drinks included we ended up paying a reasonable price of $209 for the entire group. Definitely coming back here!",

Ordered the wings and they were just blah. Salty and wet. Simply over sauced and soggy.  Looks like they just opened and may be getting the kinks out.  But really need to do better and rep the Ko food in the northwest.",

Our estimated wait time last night was an hour, and we had to wait a while before getting a table. We ordered the seafood pajeon and beef combo (exchanged the brisket for the pork belly). If you're like me and want a mixture of pork and beef combo, make sure you tell that to the sever! The bulgogi was not impressive- lack of Korean soy sauce flavor, and a bit bland. Let's talk about the pork belly though! So juicy and one of the higher quality pork bellies I've had! Ribeye had a 20% fat, but definitely not bad! I took one star out for the quality of the bulgogi and also the fact that a bowl of rice costs extra. Any kbbq regulars will know that any Korean mom and pop bbq restaurants will never charge for rice and it will always come with the meat! Overall, I would love to try the dak galbi next time and the pork belly is an absolute must!!",

We were excited to try out a kbbq place that is in the Seattle area! We know there would be a wait so we joined the waitlist 1 hour ahead of the time we wanted to come and we got in right on time, with no wait when we got there. The waiter came and got our order shortly after. We ordered the pork belly, dak galbi, brisket, cheese corn, marinated kalbi and fresh soju. The meat came with onions and asparagus, salads and sides. The grill works by turning it on the side, which is really convenient. The meat all tasted really flavorful; the cheese corn was also tasty! The service was also great and attentive, giving us water and more sides/salads whenever we ran out. There's also parking in the parking lot but it does run out quick; there's parking on the streets and lots of them which is good.

The prices are a little more on the pricey side for KBBQ and the meats were okay, could have been seasoned better in my opinion or even have better dipping sauces to help flavor the meat. The other entree/appetizers were my favorite! Cheese corn was soo good and same with the soup and omg the steamed egg!! If you like eggs then you HAVE to get this dish.

    "review": "Korean BBQ is one of my favorite things to eat, but there honestly aren't too many restaurants that serve it in Seattle. Most of the time you have to go up north or down south. When I found out about Son of a Butcher, it was a must try. AMBIANCEIt's not your traditional KBBQ spot as you're greeted with a bar as soon as you walk in. The space is split into a non-bbq section without vents, and a bbq seating area. The servers are really attentive and generous with the panchan. FOODThe first thing I noticed was the price. Be prepared to spend around $40-50 per person if you're looking to eat their bbq. But, I came for the bbq, so I had to get it. Their other dishes also looked good so we ordered a few other options as well. Brisket is the staple kbbq cut. SoB's brisket is honestly great. High fat content for the perfect juicy bite. Their Pork Belly is also pretty good. Again, high fat content which makes for a great blend of crispy and fatty when you grill the pork. Their Soonduboo (tofu soup) is really high quality, as you should expect at $12. Their tofu is silky smooth, my only gripe with this dish was that they skimp a little on the meat. Great taste, I would have liked it to be a tad spicier. The game changer for me was their cheese corn. Honestly the best cheese corn I've ever had. At $8, it's a little pricy, but just get it. The rich, cheesy, buttery bites of corn just complement the meats so well. OVERALLYou get what you pay for here. The premium price tag is reflected in the premium cuts of meat and high quality ingredients. I wasn't a huge fan of their grills, as the induction heating was a little uneven at times, but overall I love this place.",

The interesting: The table air grill was mesmerizing...how that worked through their tables!? .. but its ingenious and makes sure you can use a table regularly or with a grill.  Nice theres a retractable and adjustable vent to use or get out of the way as needed.The Food: for the 3 of us, we shared the beef combo since it seemed to come with the most variety and value, and the quality of meat was good and not frozen.  Flavors were fine though the different dipping sauces made it better.  Egg souffle and pajeon was enjoyed, especially that kimchi and potato salad!!   Note that rice does not come with your meal and needs to be added to your order if you want some.  Was also sad we couldn't sub out the soup for another soup for few more dollars but by the end, we found we were comfortably full and didn't even finish everything that came with the combo.  The verdict: In the end, it is on the spendy side for non ACYE BBQ and I think there may be different prices posted in different places for the same thing so may want to clarify what the price is first before ordering.. but it is a decent option for Seattle.",

    "review": "I think its finally safe to say that theres great kbbq in Seattle now! This new spot is a little small, so be weary when coming in with a large party/peak hours. One unique thing here is the grills are heated through induction so there is no actual heated grill, and the exhaust vent can be pulled down from the ceiling right by your food, to any desired height.In terms of the food,  the quality is definitely there. The meat is super fresh and flavorful, the banchan is spot on (ESPECIALLY the kimchi) and the other pairings were fantastic. I bought the beef combo and it's very well worth it as you get the fermented soybean stew, steamed eggs (with a huge mountain of tobiko roe & green onion) and a little cheese fondue to dip your meats into. The only caveats are no rice comes with the meal, as well as the pricing being a bit high. I understand this is in eastlake, but the serving size could be bigger for the price. I'd like to point out that the yukhwe here is some of the best I've ever had, as well as a FAT serving for the price -  HIGHLY recommend getting this.Overall, I had a great experience and I highly recommend checking this spot out at least once. Its refreshing to finally have good kbbq in Seattle and I'll definitely be back to try the other offerings on the menu!",

    "review": "So happy to have found my new fav Korean restaurant in Seattle!!! The food here is most definitely comparable to the what you can get in LA K-town! Prices are a bit steeper, but I think the quality of meat more than compensates for the price. Keep in mind that only about around half the tables in the restaurant have a bbq grill option, so make sure to come early to beat the lines and/or put your party down on the Yelp waitlist! We came at ~5:15 on Saturday with a group of 5 and waited around an hour for our table.  More on the food:The dakgalbi (spicy stir-fried chicken) is a must order! It's a perfect balance of spicy, sweet, and savory, and I love how the chicken, veggies, and rice cake really soak up all the flavors of the sauce.My favorite part was defs the fried rice!! The fried rice + eggs marinate/cook up in the remainder of the dakgalbi sauce and make for a perfect end to the meal. I'm not typically too hyped for fried rice but honestly this sauce is like crack I couldn't get enough of it!  We also ordered the pork belly, and we were all so impressed by the quality! It had a very balanced meat to fat ratio and was insaanely tender/juicy. Would defs order this again as well!Alsoo loved their kimchi/other side dishes...we asked for at least 3 refills lol. If I could buy tubs of their kimchi I totally would! Overall, I would say the food at Son of a Butcher is 5/5, but I wasn't as pleased with the service... Servers were a bit inattentive, and often seemed confused when we asked questions about the menu. Still, this wouldn't stop me from coming back the next time I'm craving some quality kbbq!",

When we came, they did not have their liquor license yet.The overall experience was A-OK! I wasn't blown away but I wasn't disappointed either. The service was really friendly. The food was good but a bit over priced but it is in Eastlake. We ordered the brisket (1 order so it came out cooked for us, which was fine) wings (on the sweeter side) and seafood pancake. Banchan comes with it and you're able to get refills. The food was good.I guess 3 stars b/c of the pricing. I just don't know if it was \"WOW\" enough for me for the price. It wasn't anything different or amazing, compared to other Korean places.The brisket is $22 with banchan but they don't serve rice with any of the dishes. So if you ordered that dish alone and added rice like we did ($2) it's $24 before tax. Not worth it to me and I didn't even pay for the meal lolThe food was good, they were friendly, probably will be better when they get their liquor license.IDK go check it out for yourselves :)",

This makes us a little bit more critical of Korean bbq since we have experienced some of the best kbbq.----We got there at 6pm on a Tuesday and had no wait. On our way out at 7pm there was a small crowd of people waiting. Parking lot is really tight so I would recommend street parking if you can. We ordered the marinaded kalbi, pork bulgogi, kimchi pancake, corn cheese, and the cheese fondue for dipping. The banchan included kimchi, seaweed salad, potato salad, mixed green salad, and another dish I can't recall. We also were given 4 dipping sauces for the meat as well.The grill comes out preheated and on a platter that I think is warmed through a heating unit under the tables not sure how it works exactly but the beginning of our dining experience half the grill was hot and the other half had very little heat so things were cooking unevenly. The kalbi was good although the marinade wasn't really flavorful. The meat itself was tender though. The pork bulgogi was also pretty good as well. The cheese fondue dip I didn't enjoy as much as I thought I would but was a nice touch. I can't tell what it was but something was really salty. The kimchi pancake was cooked well and the corn cheese was yummy. I also actually liked the mixed green salad that came with the banchan. I don't know if they refill banchan like traditional kbbq but it wasn't offered. They forgot to bring our rice but we had a good amount of food that it was ok to dismiss. Minor gripe.The one thing that kinda bugged me was they don't change out the grills. This means if your grill is smoking and charring up burning your meat, you are stuck with the same grill. They will allow to add more oil to the grill but it's not changed out.. between this and the uneven cooking I'm -1/2 a star. Overall it was decent price and decent Korean bbq.

Once we were seated, we got the beef and pork combo platters, which came very quickly. I saw some reviews say the service was bad, but I found the waitresses very pleasant and professional.Both the pork and beef combos come with a steamed egg and soybean stew which were very tasty and were large portions. Everything in the pork combo was very tasty, with the highlight being the pork belly. I mean, you can't go wrong with pork belly right? The meat was super juicy. The beef combo was also great, with the exception of the steak. The steak was a little lackluster compared to the rest of the combo in terms of flavor. If I were to come again, I think I'd get the pork combo and just individual beef items instead, like the brisket. In general, I'd come back. The food was good but a little pricey.

    "review": "I was really excited to see a new KBBQ/Anju closer to home, but I was mostly disappointed. When my group arrived, we waited 15 minutes+ before being signed in. We were clearly acknowledged by the workers but were completely ignored, making us feel unwelcome. After being signed in, we waited another 20 minutes+ all the while staring at available(?) tables. Based on my experiences at other KBBQ, I'm fine with adequate service. However, I feel like because this is a new establishment with younger employees, higher prices, and contemporary decor, service could be more enthusiastic and welcoming. I wasn't too bothered by the wait until we were seated and service remained slow. We were also seated at a uncleaned table, but was cleaned once the server noticed. For a side, we ordered Corn Cheese which was delicious (sweet and cheesy) but on the smaller side. Sadly, alcohol wasn't available yet. Next came out the Dak Galbi (\"spicy\" stir-fried chicken), it was my first time trying and I thought it was good. For KBBQ, we ordered Kalbi Short Rib, Brisket, Bugolgi and Pork Belly. All of which tasted great. Seaweed salad, potato salad, pickled radish, and kimchi were provided for the banchan. The kimchi was really good and was the most memorable banchan. There was also 6 dipping sauces provided. Personally, I really care about my rice *especially* at KBBQ and they forgot to serve us our rice. This took a while before we got a server's attention despite the tables around us also being unattended. There was also many times we needed refills on water and banchan but was unable to find a server. Overall, the quality of the meat tasted good. However, I don't think it was exceptionally better especially given the portions and price. Therefore, I'm willing to sacrifice a bit of quality for AYCE. I also don't think it was worth the time spent here (2 hrs+). If you like Korean food, I don't think you will be disappointed by flavor. However, the flavor isn't unmatchable therefore I don't feel the need to come back.",

Food honestly was good but I think it's worth 25-30$ at most...  service was nice. I just wouldn't come back not worth that much. WAIT TIME BREAKDOWN:Also let's break down the wait time. Estimated was 180-221 mins to be 11th in the queue. If you waited 3-4 hours, the turnover of the entire restaurant should happen AT LEAST once, maybe twice. Maybe 3x for certain tables. There's at least 10 tables in there. We DEF should've had a spot sooner than this. Why didn't we? Cause they're letting people who walk in and ask completely cut the line, that's why your spot in the queue barely budges. We were 11th in queue and didn't move for 1.5hrs. That doesn't add up. This is what happens when anyone walking in can cut the line. We went in and saw the tablet had 31 parties  in line. Yeah sorry, you're def not eating tonight before it closes. And we had sunk more and more time down the drain so we kept trying to wait it out (Oh it's been 2 hrs... at 9pm we'll quit...) but imagine just thinking you're coming up soon and you're really not at all.

I called and asked them if I could add avocado to my order, offering to pay for it over the phone. They said no. Then I offered to pay more than what the charge of avocado would be and they still said no. I understand that they have a business to run and that my charge would have been an inconvenience to them, but coming from someone who has also worked in customer service, I would have just added the avocado with a charge. Let me not forget to mention, the steak salad wrap cost 20$ and the delivery fee was 17$. So, in total I paid 44$ for a wrap and couldn't receive a 3$ avocado. . I tried canceling the order after they said that but they would have charged me 22$ regardless. So, needless to say, this dinner I was so looking forward to have turned into an expensive wrap without the avocado I loved. Honestly, if your in U-Village, just head over to Joey's.

We ordered the usual. When the chili arrived I was so excited and after the first bite, I was so disappointed since the Chili was cold. Yike. When you are cold and come for chili, the worst thing is cold chili. The manager took my chili to warm it up. By the time the chili came back, i had finished eaten the sweet potato fries (very few of them) without the chili since I was hungry. The chili arrived almost when my husband has finished his meal and to begin with, this delay was a disappointment to start with since it took away from the experience of our date night. The chili came back very dry and the color had changed as though they had fried the chili. I took a bite and it burnt the heck out of my mouth. My tongue was burnt and the skin from the roof of my mouth came off. So painful. So not only the chili was not good, but it was DANGEROUSLY hot. The waitress took the chili away and said we will not charge you. That is not a great customer service since I didn't eat anything so, for sure they had to take this off of our bill. But no apologies or anything. I was dumbfounded of how poor the service is and how they didn't care that their food caused pain. I asked to speak with the manager, Amanda. She was not better. When I told her the my mouth is so burnt and is painful, she said \"we tried to bring the chili back to the right temp.\" Well, the right temp is not so dang hot that causes burn. She said, \"we took it off your bill.\" Yes you did, because it was not edible. When I told her how disappointing it is to come in for a date night after a long week working for your comfort food and have an experience like this, she said, \"sorry\". That is it. When I told her that I am going to write a review on Yelp and Google on this experience, she said, \"wait, I can give you a couple of comp coupons for a free meal.\" Amanda, I can pay for my own meals, but you should have offered that when our food was wrong and when I burnt my tongue. For me, this shows how poorly managed is this restaurant. 1. the cook/chef doesn't know the right temp for food2. the waitress didn't understand a thing about customer service and treated us like a cattle that we need to get out and not charging us for a food item that we could not eat was a great customer service.3. The shift manger, Amanda, had no clue the seriousness of this issue of food safety and she had no idea of how to handle this. She just tried to do something after i said I am going to write a review. I hope this review will be viewed as a call to action by the GM to improve customer service and food safety. Very disappointed and even two days later, I can't eat much due to my burnt mouth.",

    "review": "Update: I just noticed the restaurant's GM, Mr. Cosgrove, send me a message and apologize for the bad experience we had about the food.  And offering me a giftcard for us to go back to give them a second chance.  Regardless to our previous experience, I have to credit the managements who are willing to reach out to their customer and attempt to make things right.  That mean a lot to me, as a consumer.  And just for that, I am updating my starts from 1 to 3 to show my appreciation.  Thank you, Mr. Gosgrove.=================================================We stopped by for a quick lunch yesterday.The waitress that served us, Jenn (got the name from our receipt), was awesome! She was super friendly, and attentive to us.We were seated on a little tiny two seaters by the wall.  After we placed the order, we saw there were three bigger tables were empty, and it wasn't during the rush hour, so I asked the waiter who were right next to us, to see if we could move to one of those bigger tables.  He was very friendly, and told us, sure that shouldn't be a problem, and he was going to talk to our waitress / hostess/someone about the seat change for us.  But few mins went by, the nice gentleman came back and told us that those seats were on waitlist already for someone else, so he can't switch the table for us.  I could feel the guy feel sorry for not able to switch the table for us and I feel kind sorry for put him on the spot to feel sorry for us.  So I guess that was it and life went on.  And then until we finished our lunch and took off, our side of the restaurant were only get emptier and emptier, and those three tables that I was hoping to move to, has always been empty during our entire stay.... so....  I guess my request to switch to a more comfortable seats during their non-rush hours was totally unreasonable for their management..... I feel ashamed of myself making such a horrible request.....Food wise, we ordered a Fish and Chips, and American Cheeseburger.Pro:1. we ordered unsalted fries for our side dish.  Fries for both of our plates were one of the best that we have ever tasted.  I am not sure if its their seasoning, or the texture of the fries, or whatever the magic they put on it, Fries is absolutely amazing.Con:1. The Fish seems to be too dark in color to me, as if they have not change oil of their fryer for a very long time kind of dark.  When my fish and chip plate was served, my first thought was maybe they over-fried the fish and it was going to be like a solid rock.  However, after eat into it.  even bread looked dark and hard solid, it was actually pretty soft.  After digged into it more, I started to taste mix of batter + fish + skin.... almost like inner part of the batter was not cooked/fried and its still raw.  My guess was, again, that its possible they haven't change their dirty oil of the fryer for a long time, and when they fried the fish, it became excessively dark too soon, so they have to take it out before its properly cooked...2. we ordered our cheeseburger in medium.  Most part of it was pretty good, until we started to taste bitterness / burned from the meat, and not sure why some part of the meat could be badly burned for a medium done burger?Price wise, its $17 for fish and chip, and $12.50 for a cheese burger, and $5 for a tiny glass of Lemonade.  I think its excessively expensive for what I get, but that's the price of dining in this city /area, so I won't be a crying baby about it.However, if you asked me if I ever coming back again? My answer is no.  We had a fantastic experience with the waitress who served us, and that's about the only memory that I will take with me for this place.  There are way too many other places that we could go for much better quality of food, and willing to accommodate to my unreasonable requests.",

    "review": "A great option for University Village especially with its excellent food safety rating.  (I had the misfortune of eating at an Asian spot here which is popular since a friend insisted and fell really sick afterwards and later noticed that restaurant has a super low needs improvement rating).  We loved the patio especially with our pup in tow.  It was a pleasant evening.  The fried chicken sliders were yummy but definitely not filling enough without fries. They were sweet because we eliminated the firecracker aioli (spicy), but overall they were satisfactory and definitely a great choice. The Napa Chicken Sandwich was great. The chicken was moist and flavorful and the oven-roasted tomato exploded inside your mouth. It was a bit filling, and the bread (while delicious) was the main reason why. It was very good though and something worth ordering again. The fish tacos were wonderful. They were an appropriately sized portion and satisfying, with a little kick of spice. If you don't mind spice, it's a great order! The kids' chicken tenders were great. In the seven year old's words: \"They were very nice and crunchy and fresh\". They were a hit and with the fries made a nicely filling kids meal. We would definitely go back the next time we are in University Village and would recommend it to any other families who are looking for dinner in the area!",

The truffle fries are my favorite!! They are fried to perfection and the sauce on the side is delicious and It also comes with a good amount (both fries and sauce). Nachos are good and have a sweet taste to it which I enjoyed but was definitely a small portion compared to other restaurants and their portion of nachos. The Mac and cheese bites surprised me, I wasn't expecting to like it as much as I did. Very nice place to grab a drink and some food!",

UVillage doesn't have the most options but we decided to dine at Eureka!I have been to Eureka before but it was years ago. It was a sunny hot day in Seattle so we sat outside on their little covered patio area. My opinion, Eureka! Is known for their endless amount of beer options. I ordered a honey blonde beer and my girlfriend ordered the watermelon cocktail beverage my girlfriend said her drink was one of the best cocktails she has ever had. For dinner I ordered the Napa Chicken Sandwhich that was amazing. I am allergic to tree nuts and the sandwich usually comes with Pesto but I subbed it out with a garlic aioli and it was perfect! Very moist sand which and wasn't to heavy with my beer. My gf ordered the blackened fish tacos and she enjoy them. I took a bite and they had some spicy kick from the mango salsa on top.Our waitress was friendly, was sat pretty quickly around dinner time on a week night.

The fries that accompanied the burgers were really salty! The corn tortillas that housed the fish tacos threw off the whole dish. The meat patty in the kimchi burger had a weird texture (pork + angus) and wasn't very succulent. Definitely needed some fresh veggies to brighten and lighten up the dish. The kimchi condiment was good tho. Service was a little wonky and our server was not very attentive at all. We had to ask for roll ups (we only had one on the table and there were 4 of us) linens, forks, and for her to remove menus. The manager, however, was very helpful and kind (black gingham shirt w/ short blonde hair). The restroom was clean and there's a changing table.

I've been here for drinks only before during game days and it gets pretty packed but this review is for the lunch. We were seated right away with choice of tables and service was good but could have been better. We didn't get any refill on our drinks until we flagged someone down. First time having their food and we ordered the glazed Brussels sprouts, falafel bites as appetizers and the grilled shrimp salad and short rib burger naked (without the bun). The Brussels sprouts were a tad on a sweet side but charred well so it was balanced. The falafel while tasty was a bit oily. As for the main course, here was where I was more disappointed. The shrimp salad had some rice noodles in there and were al dente, well more like under cooked. As for the short rib burger, I probably shouldn't have ordered it naked, since it came with a arugula salad underneath the burger with lemon vinaigrette. The flavor clashed with the Kim chi on the burger and tasted just odd. I'd give this place another go when I'm around the area and I'll be sure to keep the bun on this time.",

I paid $14 for an okay burger and 14 sweet potato fries. Yes, I took the time to count them and photograph them because the value of this restaurant has substantially diminished and I vow to never come to Eureka again and will do everything in my power to discourage others from dining. A side of Brussels sprouts used to be a full 8 inch dish is now served as a 4 ounce condiment saucer. What used to be a full plate of fries is now only 14 individual spears.  It's like an abusive relationship that keeps taking more from you and giving you less.

Next was the foie gras butter, which was so rich and so good that I felt like I was doing something bad by eating it. The preserved plumb on top compliments it well and cuts through the fattiness Next was steak tartare which is something I'm not in love with and almost never order. Ya know how a lot of the times it's flavorless and bland? Not this one. This edition  is one of the best I've ever had. There was so much flavor all the while not being heavy or tasteless.

It ruined the entire experience. We stuck it out and complained to the hostess - the server that replaced him was empathetic and top notch. And guess what, we spent plenty. To the management - This server will ruin your business. He trashed the experience in front of a large group without sign of apology or remorse.",

    "review": "Needed a place that's accommodate vegan to meaty taste palette, and healthy to hearty alcohol.Went in for brunch - I was tempted by the Dutch baby, but as it's a bar known for its seasonal menu and meat, I opted for the bone broth ($10) and grilled bread ($4). My ladies wanted to share the charcuterie, and with four of us together the two portion with cheese was plenty as a side and made it affordable at $7.50 per person. But with main menu and a drink expect to pay about $40-$60 range, but drinks and food are salty and strong - not very difficult to hit the higher price range. Since it was lunch menu, it was missing the steak tartare, but overall we were quite satisfied with the service and speed. We were bit robust bunch laughing and having a wonderful time, but tables were spaced out enough we were able to enjoy ourselves without disturbing the neighboring diners. Everything was bit high on sodium, but there's enough veggie dish to balance out the protein and fiber needs. Pate and cured lamb was notably popular, and braised duck sandwich with smoked pork cheek was a unique hit item. From draft, cocktail, to wine selections everyone is bound to find beverage of choice - for someone who is reserved on alcohol, coffee with shot of 1 oz whiskey was perfect match with cream and sugar. There's also freestyle mocktail and ginger beer - but be forewarned it's 21+ establishment. But doggie's are allows by back porch. Meat is now on sale, and awesome place to take a break from kids and entertain the adults in us... that wants to remain carefree, and be done adulting for a bit.",

For our entrees we ordered 2x tri-tip sandwiches with green beans and the potato side, corned beef reuben, and the salad & bone broth soup combo. I really enjoyed the corned beef reuben and it had a nice balance of flavor and would order again.  The others also really enjoyed the tri-tip sandwich, which was totally packed with meat.  Would go back again!",

Carnivore (and umami) heaven, but with plenty of excellent veggie-based options if you're not in a meat-y mood.  The other important thing is that you'll NEVER leave thinking \"I could have made that better myself at home.  All of their dishes are truly unique, often made with house-cured or lacto-fermented items, or cuts of meat that you won't ever find in the grocery store.  I could go on and on about this place, but go check it out for yourself.  Probably one of the most underrated restaurants in all of Seattle.",

Tofu is a pretty common ingredient so it didn't feel like anything was missing!Pineapple Fried Rice: while the flavors were mainly good, I felt like it wasn't quite complete. The tofu didn't really add much to it. (Admittedly liked it 10x better when I ate it for leftovers the next day with some bacon)Vegetable Tempura: pretty good with the sauce that comes with it. Interesting choice of veggies, not your typical Japanese ones.Drunken Mushroom: Wowow this was good. My favorite dish of them all. It's pad kee mao on a whole 'nother level. Can definitely understand why it's their signature dish. So flavorful and each part of the dish works well. Would definitely get it again and it's actually a lot better than a lot of non-vegan drunken noodles I've had before!Only qualm is the pricing for single dishes. While portions are good sizes, kind of hard to imagine pricing when veggies and carbs make up a strong proportion of the ingredients. It's not a deal breaker, so I would definitely come back!",

A sweet honey glaze sauce was provided for dipping.The kitchen closes at 9:15pm and the restaurant closes at 9:30 on a Monday just as an fyi. We ultimately chose to share 4 dishes family style.

The paella and sangria had great flavor and reminded me of Spain. My wife ordered the chicken Marsala and the chef cooked the sauce without dairy as she requested. A wonderful flavor even without the cream in the sauce. Also, the chef greeted us as we entered and said goodbye when we left the restaurant. My wife and I highly recommend this place.",

The sauce was great! One of the best I have ever tasted. However the lobster ravioli was not very fresh and as someone who is sensitive to the fresh taste of seafood I can tell that it has been keep for a while. The portion was decent, but may not be enough for big appetite. My friends ordered the lamb shank, which was well cooked, soft and soaked in flavoues. The shank has lots of meat. We also ordered their seafood fried rice, which is equally awesome. Their seafood pasta is good, though not spenlendid.We can see their cheif cooking. It seems there is just one/two people preparing and cooking the food so it takes a while to get our food. They gave free bread as appetizers. We also ordered their tiramisu which I am not a fan of.

The place is small and there is almost no separation between the kitchen and the dining area. It's not exactly open concept but feels more like you are eating at home. I ordered a pasta dish, my wife the chicken masala, and my daughter another pasta dish. This is when we discovered a disconnect between the food we ate and the reviews. The pasta was mushy and not flavorful. The chicken masala was also bland and it was served with some random side pasta that was also bland. Bread was served with the meal and it was interesting. It was pale white and while it was ok, it just didn't look like bread. The wine was super basic and probably Franzia. My daughter did not like her meal, but the chef was really nice and made her some rice, which she also didn't like.Throughout the meal, the family that runs the place was really nice and there were a lot of people there. I guess I don't get it. The prices were not cheap and we left disappointed.",

I thought the shrimp wasn't too spicy, but extremely flavorful. My boyfriend ordered their jerk chicken which was also very good. Each plate came with slaw, black beans, and white rice.

My sandwich fell apart within the first few bites so I just used the fork and ate it like a salad. The bun started to get a little soggy but it was still delicious nonetheless. I think next time I'm going to try to ask for the sandwich buns on the side so that it can remain crispy throughout my meal. Other than the food. Atmosphere is a cute beachy vibe with lots of outdoor seating and actual sand. A very relaxing environment on a warm summer day.

They specialize in Cuban and Caribbean cuisine.We dropped in on a Saturday evening (around 9:30pm). We were there late but they greeted us with smiles and open arms. The girl working the front was incredibly friendly and sweet. The decor is rustic and fun; love the surfboard up on the wall, the coffee bean bags decorating the ceiling, the hipster hanging lights and the sand out on the patio. A little hidden beach oasis.The menu is split into sandwiches, plates, combos and sides. They were sold out of multiple things (pork was all gone) so we asked for their recommendations. There's also 7 beer options available on draft. Love the beer tap that's dressed up as a bowling pin.- Ten pin pineapple wheat ale ($5.25 US pint) - we decided to try out their pineapple wheat ale which was refreshing and good pineapple tones.- Trinidad steak ($13.99 US) - marinated and grilled steak. We opted for medium rare which is exactly how it was cooked; tasty and tender. All their plates come with beans, rice, mango slaw and a maduro (plantain). Portions are generous and come with a good amount of meat. We were surprised to that there was a whole layer of rice underneath everything!- West Indies ($10.99 US) - jerk spiced chicken with west Indies sauce. The chicken had some heat to it but still retained all the flavour. Good bite and tons of chicken. The plantain was legit and we both liked the mango slaw.Excellent spot to grab Cuban/Caribbean food!

To see a restaurant open nearby that specializes in suancai yu, the restaurant's namesake, really intrigued me!Immediately when you walk in, you notice that this place has a really nicely themed decor. The wallpapers are all well-designed around the idea of their fish. One wall has a giant 9-panel TV that is playing a documentary about where they source their fish. While it may feel a bit out of place, I can't deny it was kinda cute. The way this restaurant is designed definitely reminds me of a newer restaurant that might open up in China, which I really appreciated.Upon being seated, all of the staff there yells \"????\", or \"Welcome\". This may be a bit off-putting at first, and some people might find it uncomfortable, but I honestly found it incredibly endearing! When they bring the food out, the staff also yells \"??\", or \"Food has arrived\", which was just another one of those cute and endearing things.Moving onto the food, we ordered their specialty suancai yu in the small size, and two orders of hongtang ciba, deep-fried rice cake with red sugar syrup. The food came out pretty quickly, and the first thing I want to say about the fish is that despite the small size being recommended for 1-2 people, I felt like it was plenty for the party of three that I came with. The fish is undeniably fresh. The flavor is definitely there; the broth and pickled vegetables definitely do not overpower the fishiness. That being said, there was no real funk to the fish, which made it all the more enjoyable. The fish was sliced into small pieces, and it was thoroughly deboned, meaning that it was very easy to eat the fish, and there wasn't much of a hassle. What I really appreciated, however, was the fact that the broth was just the right strength of flavor. This kind of dish can definitely lean towards the saltier side at many other places, but I think that their aware that the fish and pickled vegetables already give the broth enough of that salty flavor, and so there wasn't much of a need to make it anymore salty. The fish also had a good amount of spice, but nothing that was too much to handle. But with that being said, I can handle spice pretty well, so I may not be very qualified to speak on that aspect.I don't have much to say about the deep-fried rice cake. It was very crispy and crunchy on the outside, the fry was really nice, and the inside was chewy and very mochi-esque. The flavor of the syrup takes a bit of time to really hit. At first, it might just taste like breakfast syrup, but the flavor of the red sugar comes through after a few seconds. Overall, it's a really good way to balance out the sourness and saltiness of the fish!Overall, this place is quite an enjoyable experience. The service here was really nice and attentive, though it definitely helps if you speak Chinese here. Do I think it's a bit overpriced? Yeah, maybe a bit, but I think that the flavor helps me to look past it. I'm super happy to see that there are new, fresh Chinese restaurants opening up in University District, and will definitely come back here to try new things out!",

    "review": "I've heard this place is good but a little bit expansive before I came, but now I totally understand why that is the case. Unlike most of the place that serve sauerkraut fish, the fish they use at this restaurant is extremely fresh. They have a big projection screen displaying videos that introduce where their fish come from and how they prepare the dish. Two of us ordered a small sauerkraut fish with a side of wild starch noodles and rice. Like most of my friends who came here before, we didn't finish it because the plate was just HUGE. I thought the add-ons are expensive at first but I think it's worth it after seeing how much they actually give you for the price. Our fish was served pretty fast and we were satisfied in general. The service was really nice - our servant introduce their signatures to us, constantly checked how we felt while we were eating and helped us pack the leftover in the end. It's also funny to hear all the staff shout out their slogan once for a while. They start to become busy after 6pm, so come here early if you don't want to wait. As for the price, we spend $50ish in total and I do think it's a little bit pricy even though their quality is good. I'm not sure if I will come back regularly but you should check this place out at least once if you are interested!",

    "review": "This restaurant replaced Caliburger on the Ave and is a welcome new addition to the rapidly expanding Chinese cuisine options in the University District.FOOD:The main dish served here is their signature Saurkraut Fish (more accurately, Chinese pickled vegetable fish). It's unlike anything I've ever tasted (in a good way). The numbing spicy flavor infused with the sourness of the pickled vegetables creates a complex flavor that complements the fish very well. However, its level of spiciness is not for the faint of heart - and there's unfortunately no way to adjust the spiciness. If you have seafood allergies, this is not the place for you, as this fish is the only main entree they serve. We added enoki mushrooms and clear noodles to the fish, which were a nice addition. We also ordered their chicken wings (probably the best of these three), pickled cucumber, and sticky rice cakes as appetizers, none of which were too standout. PRICE:This place is quite expensive, with a medium serving size of the fish costing $50, quoted for 2-3 people. Not somewhere that I would go very often.SERVICE:Service was outstanding. Although the place just opened, staff seemed to have the workflow down very smoothly. We were checked in on often by multiple people, and water was refilled at least four times without being asked. ENVIRONMENT:The restaurant interior is quite nice, with a large TV display combination advertising the restaurant and where the fish comes from. OVERALL:The main dish was great, although will be perceived as quite spicy for some and a bit too pricey to be eating too often. Definitely a place to try at least once and I can see it doing very well on the Ave in the years to come.",

It was nice and easy to get to via bus since I was meeting her and coming in from Pioneer Square. Got there a little early but was seated immediately. Love the space lots of natural light during summer dining, beautiful mural by a friend and artist Dozfy that separates the bar dining space from the dining area towards the back. The menu was up to date with what was online that was nice, some places you get to and it's a totally different menu. I was seated on the bench near the window, my friend was across on an uncomfortable wooden chair. I realize now I should've asked her if she wanted to switch seats. I ordered a cocktail while waiting for her to arrive and had narrowed it down to three the waitress was very informative I ended up going with the Vesperado: Rose  vodka, gin, rhubarb and Lilet I was trying to stay away from something too sweet this did the trick. My friend started off with Dungeness crab custard appetizer that came with toasted brioche sticks. A big fan of the oxtail at served at Junebaby my friend selected the halibut that was prepared with oxtail bordelaise, bok choy, peanuts & ginger-scallion vinaigrette the skin came crispy creating a very beautiful dish. Fish was cooked perfectly and she loved the sauce I had a taste very delicious the only issue was the bok choy was a little too el dente for her. The scallop risotto is what was calling me when I looked at the menu online and I stayed with it prepared with  Calabrian chili, cilantro, agretti and X.O. sauce. Perfectly cooked, scallops were mixed in the dish itself and the X.O. sauce was perfectly balanced didn't cover up the flavor of the scallops. I ended the meal with the other item I had my eye on the Pavlova Trifle: coconut meringue crumble, passionfruit crémeux, mint granita & mascarpone cream. Loved the texture and flavors the mascarpone wasn't my favorite part of the dish but that's a personal taste on my side. I had given my friend a gift for her birthday last month and the waitress added a candle to the dessert to celebrate her nice touch. Had a wonderful evening visiting with my friend and our water glasses were never empty. Another wonderful meal at a Chef Edouardo establishment. Looking forward to my next visit to his impeccably managed restaurants.",

I finally made one recently for brunch and I am so glad I didn't procrastinate any longer! To start I had a coffee - not your basic diner coffee, but good high quality stuff! Not watered down - thank you! Then we had the unique and intoxicating bloody stone (mary) with guava (how did you know I love love love guava?!?) followed by the orchard - this drink left an impression in my mouth for hours after leaving the restaurant. I can't say I have had that experience before in a restaurant! What an amazing concoction!For brunch I had the burrata - a delicate dance of oozy mozzarella with pesto aioli, picked onions, mint, and falafel. I loved every bite and was so satiated I didn't even finish the bread that came with it. I know, the dish was THAT good. My brunching partner had the feijoada - the plating alone was enough to make this pescatarian swoon. I tasted a tiny part of this and was impressed with the nuanced flavors and textures of the dish. I don't dole out 5-stars very often for brunch so this place really wowed me on all fronts. Service was good, the ambiance was warm and inviting - so much so that I didn't realize how blustery it was outside when we left, and the food speaks for itself.

I've been communicating with Weichy, Salare's Service Director, for a month in preparation for a friend's birthday dinner. She was extremely accommodating, friendly, professional, and inviting. She was open to any and all requests and suggestions I made. Granted, a lot of it would have to come out of my own preparation and effort, but they were open to allowing all of it, but she helped me execute half of it, which made the evening that much more special for our friend. She even called me the day before to give me (my table) the first chance at ordering their seasonal pork shank (butchered freshly in-house) that wasn't even on the menu. We took her up on that offer and I am so glad we did. It was incredible. The braised pork was literally fall-off-the-bone tender.For appetizers, we had the Cougar Gold Cheddar & Chive Biscuit and Salumi & Charcuterie. Both fantastic choices as you'll see by the photo.For dinner, we shared family style with the 1) pork shank (which, again, wasn't on the menu). You'll see by the photo how amazing it looks, and it tasted just as amazing. 2) Cavatelli squid ink pasta. Surprisingly the sauce was very light and tasty. 3) Casarecce pork fennel sausage pasta. Wonderful, classic style pasta. 4) Monkfish with purple savory clams, honey mussels, fennel & bouillabaisse broth. I could probably do without the monk fish ONLY because I'm generally not a fan of fish (let alone monk fish), but I'm all about new experiences, and I can appreciate a good sauce, which this dish had. All in all, absolutely wonderful meal and evening. The service was impeccable and friendly and I will be ever grateful for Salare's hospitality. Will absolutely -- without a doubt -- be back.",

    "review": "I vacillated between four and five stars. What pushed me to five stars was the realization of what chef Edouardo Jordan was trying to accomplish here.Salare is a fusion of his southern (Florida) roots, his African heritage, and his training and accomplishments at such diverse places as Italy (learning charcuterie), The French Laundry, Per Se, The Herbfarm, Sitka & Spruce, and Bar Sajor. What a fusion!The food here is incredible and creative. This place will challenge your palate--even for what you thought was going to be a typical preparation of some main ingredient you were familiar with. The other ingredients and the spicing in the dish (not to mention the preparation techniques) are likely to bring flavor combinations you've never experienced before to your palate. That's a good thing. Different can be good. Relax and enjoy.Always up for a challenge to my palate, I tried the tripe with porcini mushrooms, nantes carrots, chickpeas, and hen egg. The spicing whispered of influences from both Africa and The French Laundry. It was piquant and mildly peppery, creamy and varied in texture at the same time, and completely delightful. I've had many preparations of tripe around the world, and this was the best I have tasted. It was also very filling.My dining companions both had the sliced ribeye, with baby potatoes, padrón peppers, beets, and horseradish ricotta. That was also a tasty dish, with an exotic mix of spices on the meat.We passed on appetizers this trip to try the desserts. The spiced squash sorbet was good, with both some familiar and some inventive spicing. The roasted pumpkin crème brûlée (with cinnamon madrona crème fraîche, pepita bark, candied squash, and maple bacon macaron) was among the best crème brûlées I've had, and the various flavors all blended well. The pavlova (with spiced pears, buttermilk granita, lemon thyme curd, fromage blanc mousse, and fig sherbet) was a smorgasbord of pleasing desserts one one plate. And the plum upside-down cake (with plum wine grenade, peach caramel, brown butter streusel, and lemon verbena ice cream) was the star of the desserts, and one of the most amazing tasting and palate pleasing desserts I've ever had.Portion sizes are reasonable, neither huge nor tiny. Just right really, given the unique taste combinations you will experience.It's easy to see why Edouardo Jordan won the 2018 James Beard award in May as Best Chef: Northwest for his work here. (His newer restaurant, JuneBaby, is just down the street. It won the 2018 James Beard award for the Best New Restaurant in the USA.)We will definitely be returning to try more of this food. And you should too. Especially if you can't get in to JuneBaby. The difference is Salare is African-influenced fusion. JuneBaby is pure, straight-on African-influenced Southern USA food. And Salare is larger and takes reservations for all party sizes. You can't miss with either.",

So thoughtful. Also free diapers. And they have a kids menu that has easy to like foods and VEGETABLES, so it's actually fairly healthy, which is nice.We also loved watching the kitchen work, and we like knowing that all the staff gets fairly paid with the tip that is included in the bill.  And whoever is making the pate de fruits that comes with the check... we love that touch!  Such a nice palate cleanser.  We will absolutely keep coming back for more of everything.",

    "review": "I really enjoyed my meal here. We were able to sit at the chef's counter and watch them at work, which was fun as well.  In all we ordered five dishes. The cheese and chive biscuit was delicious, though a little dense. The asparagus with duck egg was a favorite. Spears were cooked perfectly and all the flavors melded together really well. Loved the duck egg!!  I don't know what the red sauce was on the bottom but it was delicious and I ate it with the biscuit as well. The buratta was beautiful in presentation and the taste and flavors work really well together, though the texture of the burrata was different -  a little on the watery side. The lamb entree was succulent and super tender. The flavor was awesome, though not a very large piece.  Between the two of us we got maybe 4-5 small bites each, but it worked for me since it helped us savor the food and also cut down on the richness. We ended the night with the upside down cake dessert, which was delicious as well. Paired well with the coconut ice cream. All our service had a huge smile and was super friendly from beginning to end. Even the chefs were sociable as well. The dishes came out sequentially and in fast order. From beginning to end, everything came out within an hour.  Would definitely return here again and look forward  to it!!",

    "review": "First time here and we were blown away. We were able to snag a last minute table near the end of the Thanksgiving weekend and couldn't have been more thrilled. The cheddar chive biscuits lived up to all the hype; yes they are dense, but they are also like a croissant. And they embody the best qualities of any bread product that you would like; flaky, buttery, chewy, light, soft, crunchy, layers.. you name it. Best biscuit I've ever had. Of course the butter to go with it is great too. Drink wise, we dabbled in the Pinot Noir's, Bonnie Lass, and Magnum PI. All were incredible. The drinks were impressively balanced; not overly sweet or anything weird, but distinctly unique. Food wise, we had the Lumache with anchovies and Duck with quinoa, huckleberries, brussel sprouts, and chantrelles. The pasta was silky and rich and (much to my worry) was not overly anchovy-y. The duck was the best duck I've had and all the flavors on that plate married perfectly. Similar to a thanksgiving dinner, but elevated a few standard deviations. We cleaned off our plates in record time. All in all, it was an incredible meal, great service, and a decent price tag. We wanted to order way more, but we just couldn't fit it in. We'll have to go back to try all the apps and probably any of the main entrees.",

Clear favorites were the Lumache, Arancini, and Beef Tartare. Make sure to order a side of bread if you're going to have the tartare. The only miss was the dessert. Wish we ordered something else, but other than that I would recommend this place. Just make sure to go there early so you can find decent parking.",

It was super thoughtful of them as they knew Salare has been on my yelp list for a while ;DThe interior is cutely designed, and the service was great! And the food..words can't describe how delicious each dish was! For an appetizer, we got the Cougar Gold Cheddar & Chive Biscuit. Words cannot describe..it literally is the best biscuit I have ever tried! I would go back just for their biscuit ;D For the main dishes we got the Casarecce, which is black morel mushrooms, hazelnuts & Lacinato kale pesto. It was quite yummy. And for our sea dish, we got the halibat which came with bean salad, zucchini, porcini mushrooms & kumquat coulis. Our final dish was another pasta dish made with ink squid. It didn't look very appealing initally, but the taste was delicious! Overall, all the dishes were great, but the star of the show was the biscuit!",

Never been to a place where the bathroom had baby diapers, first aid kit. That's really considerate and above and beyond for a place. The squid pasta with perfectly cooked scallops is a must. The beets salad with fresh grapefruit was refreshing with delicious pistachio butter. The artic char was good but the reason why I give a four star instead of 5 for this place. I have had better. The fish skin nice crispy but the fish was slightly dry just a touch. Nice service. Like how they know the menu and explain each piece with excitement and detail.The dessert Pavlova was perfect reminded me of ones we had in New Zealand. Can't find this dessert in too many places so was excited to see it on the menu and done so well.",

Now that I have a little more income I was able to enjoy the main entrees. Starting off with the appetizers, we had fried calamari. It was very large enough to serve 6 people. I came here with 4 other people and there was a lot left over. I got the seafood linguine and the portion was giant. There was a mix of clams, muscles, scallops and various fish. Over green linguine pasta. My friends got the salmon, halibut and chowder. They said the salmon needed sauce, like a white garlic butter or soy sauce. Over all the servers are very nice and attentive. We were also able to sample some of the wine before ordering. Which I didn't know you could do. This place is kinda expensive. So I wouldn't come here without an occasion. Very nice for date nights, birthdays or anniversaries.",

The Salmon pieces and potatoes made it so hearty and rich. It was yummy to my tummy. It was refreshing not to have to eat clam chowder. I want more salmon chowder. I also tried the mango wings. They were ok nothing special. Another appetizer I sampled was salmon kabobs. The sauce was heavenly, but the salmon wasn't seasoned enough. For my drink I had a blood orange martini. It was perfectly made. The bartender was great and was able to give me food information as a tourist. I left happy and full. The salmon chowder was definitely tasty and the highlight of my happy hour.",

The restaurant itself is situated in a somewhat secluded area but we were able to find it. The interior of the place has some quirky decor but an overall cozy atmosphere. We were seated immediately with a good enough view of the city lights. Our server (Marcus) was super nice as he wore a smile on his face, was patient, and cracked jokes. We ordered the fish n' chips, chicken saltimbocca, and a bowl of mussel soup that Marcus recommended. The food came in around 15 minutes and we were ready to eat!*disclaimer: I don't eat fish usually so take this paragraph with a grain of saltI couldn't really taste the cod in the fish n' chips but I've also not had much experience with it. The breading was thin but crunchy too. The chicken was okay but I would recommend getting the fish n' chips instead if you don't like seafood. The winner of our meal has to be the mussel soup though. I can't really say much about the mussels themselves but the soup was filled with flavor! All the food is quite expensive ($20-30) so I would have given this restaurant a 3/5 if judged by the food alone.I give back one more star however as the service was amazing! Marcus really made us feel comfortable as he checked up on us throughout our meal. His recommendation was also my parent's favorite so he knows what he's talking about!",

So much fun to sit outside on a sunny weekday for lunch and watch the seaplanes take off or the water taxis drop off patrons at the dock to eat here. The restaurant itself is also charming. As you enter the beautiful cedar replica of a Northwest Native American longhouse, you are surrounded by old photos, artwork, canoes suspended from the ceiling and historical photos. Beautiful totem poles grace the property, too. For lunch, try the wild Alaskan smoked salmon chowder. Such a delicious bite. They are also famous for the Keep Clam, Clam chowder which we did not try. The alder grilled wild salmon sandwich was delicious. Served with a side of waffle sweet potato fries on a brioche bun with a pesto-basil aioli, this was a great choice for lunch. Surprisingly, the Alaskan cod fish and chips were just okay. Plenty of free parking made this an easy last stop before our flight back home. It would also be a great place to come at sunset.",

I haven't had such good seafood in a LONG time as it can be hard to find. We started the meal with a Caesar and mixed green salad (both $7.50) as well as the mussels ($15). The salads were yummy (not much to say about salad) and the mussels were fantastic. The sauce they were in is great! Super fresh and delicious! For our main we got the northwest fish plates ($37), the coho salmon ($36) and the halibut ($38). All of the dishes were fantastic! I got the northwest fish plate and it was great - it came with potatoes, broccolini, scallops, salmon, and halibut. It was the perfect dish to try several items. The salmon and halibut entrees were great too! The salmon had more of a Mexican and Asian flair as it was served with a ginger and mango salsa. The halibut was topped with a DELICIOUS fig salsa! We devoured our food! I totally recommend this place!! The food was fresh and really good! The atmosphere: we chose to sit outside which was AWESOME! we got to see boats passing by in all shapes and sizes as well as the draw bridge opening and closing.

They weren't ruined but for $37 it should be prepared properly. My husband cooks halibut at home all the time and doesn't over cook except when it was frozen before and not fully thawed. This is fresh halibut so no excuses. Since we were with out of town guests we didn't say anything.

Lunch here was an absolute treat.Picture this--a sunshiny, spring day in Seattle, sitting on a patio that looks out over Lake Union, drinking an Arnold Palmer and eating king salmon caught from the Copper River just a week ago. I told my aunt I was going to be in Seattle for a few days and asked if she wanted to go to lunch. Right away she asked me if I liked salmon and said she knew a great place. She wasn't wrong. Everything from the ambiance to the kind service and delicious food was a hit in my opinion.I don't know the exact name of the dish I ordered, because my aunt took the liberty to order for me--she said she knew what I wanted lol. Again, she wasn't wrong. The dish came with a filet of king salmon over a bed of mashed potatoes with asparagus, crispy onions, and a red wine reduction sauce of some sort. Absolutely wonderful. The only reason for four stars instead of five was that once I got to the bottom layer of salmon it was pretty close to raw. The majority of it (like 75% was fully cooke and perfect) but there was a big chunk on the bottom that was a little too rare, in my opinion. By the time I got to this, I thought it would be silly to send it back to get cooked more, so I just gave it to my aunt to take home and heat up later.Service was friendly, food came out in a decent amount of time, the view is beautiful, and the food was very good! A bit spendy (I think my dish was $40), but if you're in the mood for fresh caught salmon, it is SO worth it.",

I ordered the bacon and blue knife and fork salad and some appetizer.. I can't even remember the name.. and patiently waited for my smoked salmon chowder.  Our waitress informed me that they were currently out and they were in the process of making another batch, so she brought me out a complimentary bowl of clam chowder while we waited.. and waited and waited and waited.  At the end of our meal (about 45 min later) my chowder never came.Now.. I'm sure they know how long their chowder takes to make, if they weren't going to bring me any to start with, cause say.. they don't want to make anymore--they should have just said so.  I was very disappointed that they told me they were making more.. and it never came, and she didn't really say much until I asked about it before asking for the check and she apologized and said it wasn't ready yet.  Sounds like they're just making stuff up to appease me and felt like a free bowl of clam chowder would do the trick.  Their clam chowder was good--but we made the extra effort to go to this location JUST for the smoked salmon chowder. Everything else was okay, bf got to try the salmon platter with different kinds of salmon side by side.. I got more clam chowder on the ferry the next day.. I was hoping to have the smoked salmon chowder here so we could get something different on the ferry.. but things happen.",

I'd never had broth that had a \"silky\" characteristic previously, but that has now changed! The broth was rich, very flavorful and had that silky character that was just lovely- it probably means there's a lot of butter in it!

The amount of meat they give you in a bowl isn't that much though, but I don't mind because I had appetizers too and a side of egg. I love how the egg is so runny and goes with the ramen so well, I haven't tried the egg alone the because I'm not a fan of cold eggs, but with the ramen, it's just great. This place and Kizuki and the only ramen places I have been, and I prefer this place over Kizuki. The service is great and they also give students a discount which is amazing. I'd definitely come back here if I'm in the mood for some ramen or just something warm to eat.",

Gyoza is a little too greasy, there was oil dripping and it burned a little. I personally like to dip the gyoza with vinegar and chili oil, but soy sauce with chili oil is great too!

The noodles is just the right texture, not too hard or overly cooked.  It still have the chewiness to it.  The broth is bold and not salty.  I will say it is one of the best I have ever tried.

I really like this ramen out of the others because it's not too heavy and also I can't do spicy so this is perfect for low tolerance spiced individuals!Goma Miso ramen - this one was pretty heavy and for some reason it had a an after taste to it with each sip of the soup (bitter taste to it) which I didn't like too much but it was still good!Shiyake (salmon rice bowl) - I always like to save the rice bowls as a next meal because the ramen is enough to fill me up. I really like this bowl because the salmons soft and it's just good LOL it's not too salty. Just has good flavor to it. Cha Shu bowl - this one's really good too. The pork is so soft and so juicy. The cha shu is also used in the ramen bowl but they have a side where it's just Cha shu in a rice bowl. They braise the meat really well in my opinion. ENVIRONMENT/SERVICE: lots of seating!

Fries are not included so you have to order them on the side for about an additional $4. However, they also have a large variety of fries too including regular, waffle and sweet potato. They also serve shakes, but we weren't in a milkshake mood at the time.zMy friend ordered the spicy jalapeño burger and fries and I ordered the mushroom burger. Service was prompt.The burgers here are really BIG; I was hungry but was only able to finish half of my mushroom burger. I enjoyed the grilled mushrooms and onions on my burger, but the beef patty was rather fatty and greasy. It was the least delectable l part of the burger. My friend said his burger was very spicy and downed several cups of water. The amount of fries they gave us could easily feed at least three people, but they weren't super crispy or golden; they weren't the worst fries I've had but they were definitely not the best fries I've had either.I'm not a burger connoisseur, but like the name says, it's Just Burgers.

This was pretty yummy although I didn't get much shishito from it. The strawberry basil margarita was underwhelming for the price. For entrees we ordered the beef tamales and the taco trio. All of it was just ok. Not great or terrible but ok. I love handmade tortillas but they were so thin and single layered the tacos fell apart. Rice and beans that came with the tacos were average at best.Service was ok, food was ok, and the atmosphere was ok but slightly gross from flies. Queso was the best thing. Overall I most likely wouldn't come back or come out of the way to eat here.",

I was going to be in the area for the whole day, so why not try both!I ordered the carnitas hash, and my friend ordered the burrito with chorizo. It was a tough call for me to decide between the two. The server said her favorite was the hash, so I trusted her input which did not disappoint. My friend said the burrito was really good, and it was huge too. I'll have to return to try that next!As for the happy hour.. you get happy hour prices in the bar area all day on Sundays! My favorite was the slushy margaritas with homemade hibiscus syrup added in. I also tried the spicy margarita. It wasn't too spicy, but the seasoned rim was a nice touch. They have several $5 food items. I ordered the flautas, which had a tasty cream sauce drizzled on top. I also ordered the chips off of their standard menu. They're made in house, which are thicker than traditional tortilla chips and had a nice crunch. You get to choose 3 salsas to go with the chips for only $4.I was so curious to try their dessert flautas, but they ran out of some of the ingredients. The owner Ryan was very nice and brought us flan instead. It wasn't too sweet, and was a nice delicate way to end our snacking.",

    "review": "Stopped in for a late lunch when I was in the area. So glad I did.Arriba is taking Mexican cooking arriba, arriba, arriba--elevating the food is subtle but important ways. Don't expect the gloopy cheddar cheese nonsense of Americanized Mexican restaurants. This is much more like a sophisticated restaurant I would expect to see in Mexico City. The flavors are still decidedly Mexican, but the quality of the ingredients, the creativity in the preparations, and the execution all elevate the cuisine.Many of the ingredients are made in house, and that includes the unique salsas and the queso fresco. Other ingredients are locally sourced and high quality, giving Arriba a farm to table flair. These are all good things.The salsas are all worth trying. They are unique, appealing, and delicious--either by themselves with just chips or as an accompaniment to various dishes. I just wish there wasn't avocado in any of the sauces (I am allergic, so it keeps me from trying a couple of the salsas).The black beans that accompanied my carne asada were excellent. The spicing is unique--unless you've been to Mexico. The spices here (not going to give away the secret ingredient--just expect a mild licorice taste) are sophisticated and well suited to these beans. Excellent. Yeah, it's different. It's also excellent. Again, reminds me of something I would expect to be served at a good restaurant in Mexico City.The asada was perfectly cooked, juicy, and very tasty. I would order it again in a heartbeat. It was a bit odd at first to find my asada already cut up for me and to see it served on a bed of pea greens--but both things worked to elevate the dish a bit in the end.I tried the flan for dessert. It's different and a bit more like a panna cotta or creme brûlée type custard. Very creamy and rich. But it's not the normal texture you associate with flan. Give in. Your taste buds will thank you.The restaurant is relatively new. The menu changes with the harvest seasons, and I am sure it is changing as the restaurant gets its legs. (This is why I gave four stars for now--though I suspect five stars is coming soon. Just need to work out some tiny hiccups in execution.) You can either go along for a culinary journey that may challenge some of your preconceived (yellow gooey cheese) notions and deliver great food experiences, or you can complain.If you want to complain, then please go find some run of the mill Americanized Mexican place to frequent. If you want to see what elevated Mexican cuisine can be like without having to travel to Mexico City (or to some Rick Bayless restaurant in Chicago), then eat here.I suspect we'll see this place on a few \"best\" lists in the coming years. Here's hoping Arriba has a long and great run. I am hoping to eat here for years into the future.",

    "review": "I was pleasantly surprised during my visit to Arriba Cantina. The freshly made chips paired with the assortment of salsas was an impressive start.  I typically do not like sweet fruit based salsas however the rhubarb, pineapple, and apple salsa are each perfectly balanced as well refreshingly simple and delicious. The habanero salsa is spicy but nicely balanced by the top note of fresh orange which takes away some of the heat of the peppers. Enjoyed an order of chicken flautas which were hot, crispy and generously filled with perfectly seasoned chicken.  I had mine with the best guacamole I have eaten in years. You can taste the fresh cilantro and spices, which some restaurants skimp on, but not at Arriba (I ordered some to take home for late night noshing along with chips and salsa). The short rib tacos are fantastic. Balanced with a sweetness that is not cloying. I did eat every bite in spite of being a bit full. The dishes are designed for sharing so come hungry and pick a few options to share. Make sure the shrimp ceviche is on your list of selections. With generous portions of fresh shrimp and a marinate that is balanced (not too acidic) it was one of my favorites. Make sure you try the homemade ice cream and flan, which are quite popular. Take note that the menu is seasonally inspired so some items will be rotated onto the menu as ingredients become available. I am looking forward to the Rainier cherry margarita!!!!  It is right on the 62 bus line so I can enjoy the tequila drinks and get home safely. Arriba is a winner in my books. Stop by for a great meal. You will feel welcome the instant you walk in the door. PS. I am a bit of a Mexican food snob so the five star rating is like them winning a Michelin Star in my world!!!",

I definitely think I'll be back in the neighborhood since there are also so many great restaurants/cafe/bakery shops within walking distance of Arriba Cantina.The restaurant was spacious and clean. They do offer limited outdoor seating (I only saw two tables). Service was attentive and food came out within a reasonable time. My friend and I ordered:- 4 margs (2 tamarind, one habanero, one spicy)- shrimp ceviche- short ribs tacos - chicken flautas- peach flautas - ice cream scoopThe standout dish for me was the shrimp ceviche (huge, fresh tasting shrimp) and the chicken flautas. The short ribs were good, but I felt that the meat could have been a tad softer. The peach flautas was okay, and the ice cream IMO, wasn't worth it - it was essentially rocky road ice cream with cinnamon added in.Margs were decent - the habanero was a bit sweet and the tamarind didn't really have a strong tamarind flavor. I have had fresh tamarind before (I'm from SE Asia) and I definitely did not taste the tamarind in this. There's been complaints about the drink sizes being too small - I don't particularly mind as I care more about the heavy pour then the juice. With that being said, I think they did a good job balancing the alcohol to lime ratio.Our total came to $104 before tip. I would come back to check out HH or if I want to treat myself and splurge.",

Arriba Cantina also has all-day happy hour on Sunday with $6 margaritas (more on this below). Add all of these factors together, and you get a recipe for a very happy woman living her best tequi-life. Let's start with the drinks!Slushy margaritas are my favorite. And these do not disappoint. You can add a little syrup to it if you want some flavor: raspberry, strawberry, there may be a seasonal rhubarb coming up?, and, my favorite, hibiscus! Normally $9, these alone were reason enough to come to Arriba Cantina for Happy Hour where they are only $6. They go down very quickly. I wasn't as big of a fan of the house margarita. It wasn't bad, per say, but I tasted a lot of straight tequila. Pro: strong, con: I'm not sure if there was much else in there...Si to the spicy! Spicy margarita was on the rocks (still muddled like any good marg is) and had some jalapenos in there. The rim salt had a little kick too. All in all, a solid margarita with just a hint of some heat. Apparently, if I truly want to add some spice, I need to order the Diablo. I will report back when this has been ordered. Gee, those drinks made me very hungry. Which brings us to food!First off, the chips are delish. They are thicker and crunchy and very fresh. Chips and salsa come with an assortment. I'm a fan of the super spicy tamarind habanero (I believe), corn salsa, and red standard pureed salsa. The pineapple and verde are good and more on the mild side for those with a more delicate palate. Second, I have only had a small sampling. Overall, I can say I wish the food had more heat, but again, I like a spice level that clears the sinuses. The flautas were yummy with cheese and chicken and baked goodness. The carnitas tacos were very soft. It's a great start. I've heard great things about their brunch scramble and dessert flautas. Sadly, they ran out of the dessert flautas when I was there last (a good sign, IMO). And finally, what's the place like? For Happy Hour, loved the bar area. Loved the strings of lights and the burnt wood work. For dining and families, the dining area has lots of space, natural light, and a huge custom mural that shows the beaches of Puerto Vallarta turning into the beaches of Seattle. Super cool! While I am more of a bar person myself, I will recommend this place the next time my family is in town as there are three little ones who would love a good quesadilla while the rest of us enjoy a marg. Super dangerous location for me. I have a feeling I'll be back sooner rather than later...",

I mean just look at the two batches of chips, if your kitchen can't even consistently fry chips (maybe use a timer??) how can the other menu items possibly be good?

The first time we went we arrived at dinner time on a weekend and there was a substantial wait for a neighborhood restaurant. It was PACKED. Maybe there was a special event going on? The second time we went, also on a weekend and around dinner time, it was pretty empty and we got seated right away. The food is pretty solid but I feel like for the price and type, I get a better meal at Cactus. I got the short rib tacos without rice and beans and subbed tortillas for lettuce (keto), but it was a little clunky having to explain all of that to the server. At Cactus they offer the lettuce cup option right on the menu. The queso here is really good - we got that both times. I like the pickles but it's kind of annoying that you have to pay for a side order of them, especially when you forgo the normal rice and beans sides. One other issue on the second visit was that they brought my daughter a quesadilla with cotija cheese, instead of the Monterey Jack cheese that is listed on the kid's menu. Once we asked they fixed it, but she didn't get her food until well after ours as a result. Not sure we will be back but also not necessarily writing it off yet.",

    "review": "Came here on a busy Sunday afternoon. We walked in and luckily a small table for 2 just finished so, we were seated right away.  The server handed us a menu, although it was one-sided, surprisingly they had quite a selection. Their dishes ranged from spicy tofu soup to Bulgogi to yukgaejang to bibimbap.It was a cold frosty day so we both decided on spicy tofu soup, one pork and the other seafood. We also ordered japche as well. The servers brought us some panchan; kimchi (wasnt done yet), chives pancake (cold and not crispy), sweet potatoes (delish), fish cakes (yum) & bean sprouts (not bad) - 3 stars.After snacking on those side dishes for a few mins, our tofu soups came out bubbling hot. The server also brought out a couple eggs & cracked them right into our stone pot soups. The soup was spicy and delicious! It totally hit the spot - 5 stars!The japche finally came out after a handful of mins. At first, we couldnt really taste anything but more of just a sweetness. Then we realized it's because we have been eating the super flavorful tofu soup so, it made the noodle dish bland in comparison. So, we decided to pack the japche up and try it again later. Sure enough, the japche was definitely tastier the 2nd time around with our palates cleansed and tastes buds back to normal - 5 stars.Overall, I'd give this spot 4 stars. Service was on point and prices were fair. Looking for street parking was no fun. Main dishes were good; the side dishes can use some work. If I am in the area again, I'd like to come back to try other things on their menu.",

An Asian guy worked in front alone, he was very rude. When he took us to the table, he threw the menu on the table and walked away. Are you kidding me? I was there to buy food, not to ask for a free meal. If you really hate your job or something happens to your life, take a day off man or quit the job. He even said F*** when he walked pass us. If the restaurant still keep this guy around, I'm sure they will keep loosing more customers. The person next to us agree that the service was terrible and rude. I would not surprise that a couple walked out the restaurant after sitting down for a few minutes. I wanted to leave after saw them walked out, but I was too hungry to go find another place.It wasn't my first time eating here. Back in the day, the service was great. Today, the service went downhill. I would not come back even the foods are goods. I rather save my times and my money to eat somewhere else, where people don't treat you like sh***.",

I love the no frills interior, because I really only come for the food. It's SO good and super affordable. Always generous portions of delicious banchan to share, speedy delivery of food, and great portions for the price. I'm very obsessed with the tofu dumpling soup - super spicy broth filled with lots of plump dumplings and silky tofu? Uh yes, get in my belly. We also always get the green onion and seafood pancake to share along with the bulgogi. Their bbq dishes are equally delish.

    "review": "I've heard from my Korean friends that there is no good Korean food on the Ave and I have yet to prove them wrong. I ordered the mixed tofu soup with beef, clams, shrimp, and oyster. Mixed tofu soup, soondubu, is one of my favorite dishes as it really warms the soul. I've had authentic soondubu before in Annandale, NYC, and Seoul. This is by far the saddest soondubu experience I've had unfortunately. The soup didn't come out hot and could barely cook the egg that we cracked into it, although I know some people prefer runny yolk. When my friends and I commented on how lukewarm our soups were, a woman at a neighboring table also chimed in and said she'd observed that too and was glad others agreed. The soup was sadly very watery and thin! The rice (they give purple rice with the soup) is on the stiff side. Side dishes were alright except the pajeon (Korean savory pancake) was straight up cold. But on the plus side, the service here is good. The staff is very friendly and quick to bring banchan refills. Likely won't be coming back here given the experience with the food.",

If you're looking at the menu and don't know what to order, get the Campanelle dish with chicken, and unless you love goat cheese, swap it for Parmesan.

Also, these are the most unique pasta noodles you will ever eat. I've never had a bad experience here. And they've been nothing but accommodating when I've brought my 1 year old.

So, when we heard this place served it, we decided that we had to come try it for ourselves.Atmosphere: Probably the best part of our experience. We came in on a Wednesday night. Our area by the windows was peaceful and sparsely populated, making it the perfect location for a nice, pleasant dinner.Food: I ordered the gnocchi while my boyfriend ordered (you guessed it) the squid ink fettuccine. I was so incredibly let down by the gnocchi. It had no flavor whatsoever; it was like I was eating tasteless carbs. It was my boyfriend's first time ever trying gnocchi, and he was let down by the experience as well.The squid ink fettuccine, on the other hand, was delicious. However, the quantity was minimal. Despite also ordering a basketful of bread to share between the two of us, my boyfriend was still hungry after eating half of the bread basket plus the fettuccine. At the price point of the meal (discussed shortly), I don't think that should be happening.Price: It was $16 for each plate of pasta, plus around $3.50 for bread. Combined with tax and tip, we were looking at over $45 for a meal that didn't even make the two of us full. Yikes.Service: We received our food pretty quickly after ordering, which I appreciated. Our waiter was pleasant, but didn't go out of his way to be extra personable. Overall: Try another pasta joint for better taste and more bang for your buck. I will likely not be back.",

    "review": "Living in West Seattle, I rarely make it to University Village. I decided to make the trek to the Village over the three day weekend, and had my eye on Piatti for happy hour and to grab dinner to go. Boy, it did NOT disappoint.I am a sucker for good octopus, which isn't an item you see on a ton of menus around the Pacific Northwest. I was thrilled to see it on their happy hour menu, which is what initially drew me here. It seems they have a rotating preparation of the octopus. When I stopped in, it was wood-fired octopus with chorizo braised white beans, tomato confit, and arugula. At $10 on happy hour, it's a steal. This dish was simply to die for. The octopus was unbelievably tender and paired so well with the smokey chorizo and creamy white beans. It was a struggle to finish it all and could truly serve as a meal in and of itself. However, we did also order one order of their ciabatta bread. The bread was excellent as well: so soft and fluffy seasoned perfectly with salt, garlic, and some other herbs. It was served with olive oil and a nice herbed balsamic vinegar. I'd definitely recommend it to accompany your meal, especially at a mere $3 on happy hour.To go, I ordered their house made pappardelle and duck bolognese. This, too, was heavenly. I've had other house made pasta that was too thin and mushy. I appreciated this fresh pasta really maintained its integrity. It was still nice and elastic even after reheating at home. And the bolognese itself was perfection. Though prepared classically with carrot, celery, and Italian spices, it was really a memorable dish. The duck was a refreshing change from the typically heavy and often flavorless beef you get in so many bolognese dishes. The restaurant itself is massive. We were promptly seated and the service was friendly. The drinks are a bit on the high side, even on happy hour, but the phenomenal happy hour and killer dinners more than made up for it.Overall, I think Piatti is a must-stop when you're in the U-Village area.",

It wasn't even about the meat and cheese that comes with the plate, those were great! The brie and fig jam along with grilled bread was fantastic too.

Also, the pickled veggies I was excited about was actually carrots (only one slice) celery (fine I'll eat it) but then get this... onions. Pickled onions. Not even the purple kind you may find on a fancy taco somewhere. Why would anyone want to eat pickled onions like that?I may be in the minority here with that one.

Although I don't get to Piatti very often, I have gone there for many years, and I have loved every dining experience that I have had there.I went there last night with my best friend Ryan. I ordered the prosciutto pasta, the white bean and kale soup, and the blood orange soda. All three items were absolutely delicious. Ryan also ordered the prosciutto pasta, and he loved it. The quality of the food is that of a much more expensive restaurant, so the value for the price is very good.There is a dedicated gluten-free menu, and they have a special gluten-free pasta, which I never would have known was gluten-free given the taste, texture, and appearance! The flavors and textures blended with the prosciutto were a bit salty, a bit crunchy, a bit creamy, and a wonderful contrast of heavier nourishing flavors and lighter accentuating flavors. I'm not a restaurant critic but this food makes me wish I knew more specific and precise ways to describe it. It wasn't \"too\" anything (not too salty, not too heavy, etc). It was just right!The service here has always been excellent, but it was especially good last night.The waiter was just such a sweetheart who obviously really likes his job. He checked on us just often enough but not too often, and he was friendly, welcoming, and attentive. Our food arrived in a very timely manner.We sat out on the patio on a hot summer night. I loved the cafe lights, the trees surrounding us, and the bistro tables. The indoor atmosphere has always been lovely as well, with white linens and an open kitchen where you can view the chefs hard at work preparing your exquisite meal.I'm delighted that Piatti provides such an enjoyable dining experience to its customers in every way, and I am already looking forward to my next experience there.",

However, once you go in, you can see the care and attention the owner has put in through the small details. The cafe serves not only coffee, but a great selection of beers and wine! Also, the sandwiches are bomb.I ordered the Turkish Coffee. It's the first time I had something like this. It's thick and luxurious with hints of spice. For the 10 minutes I was drinking my coffee, I felt as if I was studying abroad and I \"like literally discovered a new me in TuRkEy\".  Needless to say, it was good stuff.",

    "review": "My partner & I went to Urban Luxe Cafe for the first time last night, and I'm so glad we found this gem! (Well, \"found\" in the sense we listened to other yelpers and went.) They had me at \"gluten-free pita,\" of course. I have to avoid gluten/egg/dairy; my SO has to avoid egg/dairy. Their menu accommodates us both, and everything was delicious - nothing that tastes like cardboard! I had the lentil and potato soup with GF pita; my partner had the vegetarian baba ghanouj wrap, and we also ordered falafel and CBD turmeric chai tea, which came in a big enough pot to share (in little cups). They seemed to be really caring about their food. The soup was really flavorful - when I order soups at other places I'm often disappointed & usually don't eat it all, but this soup I had no problem finishing. The other items were also delicious. The manager (or owner? I'm guessing) was so nice, he came by and gave us 1/2 of vegan gluten-free sesame cookie to try. That was really tasty too!We really liked the overall space. Chill is a good way to put it - no fuss, enough space, and comfortable. They even have a chess table :)Now that we know they have Turkish coffee, we'll have to go back and try more of their coffee drinks during the day. It's rare to find a good coffee place that also does food very well -- this place is just that. It has everything! Seemed like a good place to work or study in, too. Often we go to a place and we're not sure if there would be a second time, but with this place, we know there will be a second and third time.",

    "review": "This place has been on my bucket list for a while now and so I met up with a friend for coffee here.This place opens later than most coffee shops (10am-10pm) but this probably because they have happy hour and serve alcoholic drinks at night.The cafe is minimalist and modern like they advertise on their sign. It's not a good place for large groups though because most of their seating is for two people, although they do have one large table towards the back. Urban also has board games and cards for customer use and entertainment.They have a lot of coffee and food options but not a large pastry selection. Urban is unique because they serve Mediterranean food items such as kielbasa, hummus, and flatbreads. They also have breakfast sandwiches in the morning.My friend and I both ordered the salmon lox ciabatta, an iced americano, and a soy latte.I love smoked salmon and the amount they put on the ciabatta bread was very generous. It also had cream cheese, red onions, and a pickle on the side. The ciabatta was fresh and warm too. Would definitely recommend.My friend's americano wasn't super aesthetic; it was basically iced coffee in a plastic dining cup. My latte had a leaf on top, but it was fairly sloppy. Oh well- at least it tasted good!Urban Luxe has a lot of unique coffee options too that I will have to try next time. Their current winter seasonal offerings include a white peppermint bark latte and an Ube taro latte (this one didn't have coffee). Additionally, they served spiked lattes and CBD lattes too. They even sell CBD water!Service was prompt and they bring the food to your table. It's self-bus, but the worker came by to bus our table which was nice of him.Overall, 5/5 for food, service and atmosphere! Will be back here to study soon!",

You will, too, if you get by first impressions and settle in.I'm a beer aficionado. They only have two taps, but my word, what flows from them is extraordinary. Whoever is choosing their brews is a genius with a very refined taste. Just flip a coin. You'll be delighted.  30 taps on stale kegs holds nothing to these two. Hummus plate?  Standard bar food?  No sir. Their 3 dip plate redefines the genre. The dips are complex and subtle. Comes with a flaky and light baklava. Nothing like the standard honey cement.Lentil potato soup?  OMG. This soup is worth a trip from Bellevue, and I can walk here from my house.  Erase all notion of your relationship with the humble lentil. Just order it and leave 5 star review #75. Takeaway is this place is straight up foodie. Yeah, it's a great place to cozy up with your laptop, but if that's what you want, better not order anything.

They also have Mediterranean food and sandwiches -- all carefully made and fresh. The chicken basil sandwich was very good. Great for studying, working, groups and dates! Parking can be difficult to find though. You can park at a store center and walk which is about 6 mins. I was trying to find parking yesterday and found a 2 hour one (last spot ;)) that is a few feet from the cafe. Otherwise, you pay for 4 hours on the street or park for free near the residential area.

I can't Fangirl enough about how fantastic this hidden gem is! Can't help but write a second review. :)I tried Turkish coffee for the first time here, and omg, I'm in love! WHERE HAS THIS BEEN ALL MY LIFE?! The coffee is first brewed in a copper ibrik (small long-handled pot where its brewed with water, ground cardamom and bit of sugar), and then served in a tiny espresso cup. I've been on the hunt for really delicious Vietnamese coffee, but figured I would try this, since the owner recommended it. And, lemme tell you, Turkish coffee is tough competition against Vietnamese coffee... Both are strong and rich in flavor!I also tried their mocha the second time I visited, and hands down, it's the best mocha I've ever had. They use a different type of milk or chocolate, I'm not sure, but it's so flavorful yet light. So unique and different from other mochas I've had in the past. Definitely recommend.Not only are their drinks amazing, but their food is also so delicious! I tried one of their entrees on the Special's menu: Smoked Loki Ciabatta with wild caught salmon -- OMG! The flavors and serving size was perfect! Please check this place out!

I've been there twice so far, and the experience I have had was wonderful. The manager is really friendly and nice, and even gave me some Turkish coffee to try! It was my first time trying it so it was a very noteworthy experience. Note that Turkish coffee is VERY STRONG. It's pretty much a concentrated coffee. (But I mean you're in Seattle who doesn't want a strong cup of coffee). It also has cardamom, so if you're not a bit fan of spice you might want to stay away. They also sell nitro cold brew which I feel like is quite rare to find. But even besides their \"specialty drinks\", their americano was good (not mind blowing-my amazing, but satisfying) and honestly it's such a chill, relaxing space that I would definitely go again and again.",

But again big thanks to the 13 Yelpers who posted before me (3/27/18), Urban Luxe Cafe is quite the new find in Seattle's Roosevelt neighborhood. I felt compelled to drive down from Lynnwood/Shoreline, easy peasy meandering along Roosevelt from 130th to avoid I-5 South.Been here for over an hour, savored a delicious sandwich platter and wrapping it up with a damn fine mocha. Decent place to linger, so I'm posting my thoughts while onsite.It's new, been open for business maybe two or three weeks tops. Hours are decent, open daily 10am to 10pm. Bright with the large expanse of windows along the sidewalk and decent overhead lighting for you readers, writers, and artists. And yes, WiFi and lots of plugs for the laptop and smart phone crowd.Wide variety of seating, including a faux fireplace, large flat screen, and decent cafe music playlist during this initial visit.Unlike most cafes with just baked goods, Urban Luxe Cafe has really delicious savory offerings too. I tried the sandwich plate with tender kebab meat on toasted bread. The final product is warm, cheesy, and melds well with the other ingredients provided. Very generous and eye pleasing for a solo dinner. Accompanying items included grape tomatoes, pickled asparagus spears, pitted kalamata olives, dolmathes, and feta. (Postscript, noticed later that my plate didn't include some baklava per the menu. Bummer.)The larger platter would be great to share (or not!) with the warm pita, assorted dips like hummus, and pickled stuff and things.My mocha is spot on for balanced flavor, temperature, and the latte art. The barista/counterperson is very personable. Knowlegeable about the menu items and gladly will answer your questions or make recommendations. Fellow Shoreliner too. The menu has small plates, large plates, delicious sandwiches, small pizzas/flatbreads, and desserts with a Mediterranean flair. Even cupcakes! Coffee, tea, limited beer on tap and wine. Next visit, I'll have to try their Turkish coffee with cardamon and see how they compare to a Queen Anne cafe on 10th Ave W. (and that missing baklava)Yes there's Bus Stop, Wayward, Starbucks, and Broadcast up the street, but I envision Urban Luxe Cafe to be the anchor with Cafe Racer on this end of Roosevelt. Still finding their groove, but with their proximity to nearby condos, 65th/Roosevelt, major thoroughfare and bus lines, University of Washington, Green Lake, and the future light rail station....that should evolve over time. Break away from your usual and give this indie cafe a whirl. Me and 13 previous Yelpers give Urban Luxe Cafe a unanimous five stars. Terrific find!",

It took 90 minutes! 90 minutes to get a cold fennel crab flake salad. Still wonder if the crab was just a garnish on the menu to appease novice critics. The second appetizer never came and by the time we got our pasta dish we had been seated for 2 hours. We could have left, mind you. Complained even. BUT this was Saturday night. The only break we get from our 50h+ shifts/week. We just wanted to remain positive and make the best of our special evening. The manager we suspect generated a form of apology when he delivered the bill because they overcharged us for food we never received and the \"wonky\" Saturday they were having. So now not only did I lose 2 hours of my life I can not get back, but I also need to feel bad for an overpriced botched dinner experience too!? How absurd!Lesson learned: next time. We will order $100 worth of fresh organic local food, have it delivered, fix our own gourmet dinner and swear off dining out for that Seattle's dining has become a complete scam where profit drives the least scrupulous ones and where pride in your work is an art/virtue of the past.",

My first visit was due to a need for pasta and my experience there did not disappoint.  So even though I live in the Eastside, I find ways to come back. My favorite experience is at the chef's counter where they have special items you can't get anywhere else at the restaurant. That where I went my first time and I fell in love. Probably is the place I had bucatini for the first time. This trip I did the tasting and I believe I am a better person because of it. This is coming from a person who is not picky but is not the biggest fan of someone else choosing their food options. But at least they were kind enough to ask about my allergies and preferences.The highlights (there weren't any lowlights but these stood out to me:The zucchini salad and the bread dish was so good, I forgot to take pictures of them .The steak as the meat course was fantastic. The The cooked salmon was by far one of the best dishes I ever had. Not only because I could cut the fish with my fork, but because of that skin. It was the right level of crispy goodness that I was heartbroken when I finished it.And the pasta was fantastic of course. And it was made better by the great service. Caveat: You can not rely on the website to see what the current offerings are. Which means the items are made fresh, but don't have your heart set on the something you saw on their site as there are not up to date.But with the food I had, I wasn't definitely wasn't disappointed.

This is a must get item; the bread that the tartare is on top of comes warmed and toasty and the flavor of the beef is spot on. I think it was my favorite of the night!Their smoked fish is also super good, comes on warm toasted bread as well and I would highly recommend trying it.Other than that, we had their grilled halibut and pork. Their proteins are cooked to perfection as well with wonderful components to their dish that provides great textures and flavors. They didn't have any pasta on their SRW menu but I hope to come back to try them because it all looks amazing! We tried their dessert and we were at first skeptical of the triple cheese dessert but the honey and cheese and almonds was a surprisingly wonderful mix! They had homemade gelato as well and that was delicious! Their chocolate mousse was my favorite, it came with candied orange and flaky sea salt on the top.

We ordered the hamachi crudo to start (this was light and refreshing). And for our entree's, we ordered the tagliatelle, which had Dungeness crab, creme fraiche, celery, and chives. And also the bucatini, with chanterelle, oregano, parmigiano, and egg yolk. Unfortunately I couldn't try the tagliatelle because I'm allergic to crab. But my bucatini was pretty tasty. The egg yolk definitely makes all the difference in making the dish creamy and rich. It's one of my favorite Italian dishes to have. We also ordered some bread, which was $5. The food was pretty good, at least, what I was able to try. But overall, nothing really stood out to me where I would want to return for more. The service could've been a little better. Our server seemed nice but very robotic. He didn't really come to check on us as often as he probably should've. Didn't really give us any recommendations for both dinner and dessert. He just came to take our order, bring our food, clean our table, and bring our check. Sadly, our dining experience here was just, alright. If you don't mind dry service, I would at least check out the food here. We might've ordered things that weren't their specialty/popular. But for us, the food wasn't bad; it just wasn't amazing.",

    "review": "I'm not an expert in Italian food, came here for a birthday party because we need a nice restaurant for an excuse to dress up. Our party was 18 people deep, the bill was about $600 total after tax and tip, so for about $30 a head, it wasn't a bad experience. The menu changes every day depending on what they have that day. The entrees here were one of those smaller portion, artistic dishes, pleasing for the eye to look at type of deal. It's pasta so after so many pasta dishes, it does fill you up. My favorite was the agnolotti, it had the best flavor and I love mushrooms in general. The restaurant is medium size, but spacious with the option to sit at the chef's table where you can watch them cook. They are only open for dinner 5-10pm daily. Perfect for date nights, girls night out, or business dinner. Located at a corner, parking was easy enough during this hour, but then again I did got a parking ticket since after a certain time you have to have a permit, but that's my fault for not reading signs right.Tell me about your experience if you've been here or is going to after reading this review:)",

I sampled the bucatini with braised pork shank and the chicken accordingly. The bucatini was decadent, perfectly al dente, and contained some red onions which really cut the fattiness of the pork nicely. The chicken was also excellent, the crispy skin was complemented beautifully by a rich parsnip celery puree. My server was also very attentive without being overbearing. Definitely want to come back to try more of their pasta offerings and small plates!",

    "review": "An airy, light-filled, Italian restaurant.Everything was ordered from their Happy Hour menu (daily 5-6p & 9-10p, bar only).For starters, we had a dozen of their daily oysters, which were the Purple Mountains from Hood Canals. We also ordered the Ahi Crudo, Springs Greens, and Beef Tartare. The ahi crudo was delicious, with a fresh citrus taste and a good sprinkle of coarse salt.  I also loved the spring greens which came with a huge mound of parmesea, so good. The tartare was okay and only came out with three pieces of small toast.For mains, we ordered the daily fish (Halibut), daily steak (Snake River Zabuton), and the Squid Ink Spaghetti. The fish was delicate and delicious, cooked perfectly. The steak came out medium-rare, with more emphasis on rare. I thoroughly enjoyed both of these dishes. However, I thought the squid ink spaghetti was lackluster and under-seasoned. We did not order it with the extra bottarga (salted, cured fish roe). In hindsight we definitely should have but since our waiter did not mention anything about it. On a positive note, there was a lot of spaghetti. Overall, I liked most of these dishes. I did notice that the portions seemed small (particularly for the tartare and daily steak, which had 4 slices). Maybe since all dishes were from the HH menu. The service was also just okay.",

    "review": "Went to Le Messe last night; four of us ordered the Four-Course Tasting Menu.  Here's the rundown of what we got:App 1.  Beets w/oil-cured olives and Marcona almonds in a vinaigrette: Very tasty.App 2.  Hamachi Crudo (Hamachi fish, served raw) with shaved kumquat, chilis, and celery: Good, but a bit too mild in flavor.App 3.  Fresh mozzarella slices topped with some kind of chunky orange-red sauce (not sure what it was): this was my least favorite dish -- pretty blah, under-salted, and the flavor and appearance of the orangey-red stuff on top of the cheese was utterly unidentifiable; the only thing I could identify were some mustard seeds.  I didn't care for this dish much.App 4.  Delicata Squash with Rapini and black olive: the squash was delicious, but the rapini was pretty bitter, even for rapini.App 5.  Salad of leaf lettuce with candied pecans, freshly-grated Parmigiano-Reggiano, and balsamic vinaigrette.  Very tasty.Pasta 1. Cacio e Pepe Pasta (rigatoni w/cheese and pepper) with actual/real white truffle (not \"truffle oil\"): Very delicious!  Given that (I believe) they make their pasta fresh every day, I expected a more delicately-textured pasta.  It was a little on the thicker, sturdier side, which wasn't a bad thing - it's just that I wasn't expecting that.  However, it was fully cooked, yet remained al dente.  I actually liked the chewier texture.  The sauce is made of Pecorino Romano and black pepper -- with the added bonus of white truffle -- and served with more grated cheese on top - yummy!!!Pasta 2.  Agnolotti (a stuffed pasta) that was filled with short rib, served with Delicta squash and either hazelnuts or Marcona almonds.  Very delicious.Protein 1.  Sea Scallops, with parsnip-and-celery root puree, and fried parsnip chips, in Salmoriglio (a Southern Italian condiment made of lemon juice, olive oil, minced garlic, chopped oregano and parsley, salt, and pepper).  Good, but not great in my opinion.  The scallops seemed to be properly cooked, with a good sear on at least one side, but it seemed under-seasoned, and something in the dish tasted a little bitter.Protein 2.  Short Ribs.  I loved them, but I'm very partial to short ribs, so I may not be very objective.  Everyone seemed to like them, but maybe not as much as I did.Dessert 1.  Chocolate Brownie, with sea salt, whipped cream, almonds, and a raspberry sauce: Good; the sea salt made it better.Dessert 2.  Mascarpone Cake with roasted (or poached?) plums and whipped cream.  Good.  It's a small restaurant, but when we got there (5:30) it was still fairly empty, so it wasn't noisy.  However, a large group that arrived a little later was seated next to us, and they were very noisy.  The décor is all hard surfaces, so it was very loud.  This is a downside, in my opinion.  Also, we were there for a long time - over 3 hours.  So, the hard bench seat we were sitting on was getting pretty hard by then, if you know what I mean.  Fortunately, we didn't get any dirty looks or vibes indicating that we really needed to move along, and I appreciate that.  (I was keeping an eye on the host station to see if people were waiting to be seated, and I never saw that happen, so I guess we lucked out.)When we're in the mood for pasta, we'll put this place on our list of options, so we may well come back some time.  But I'm not feeling that \"I've just GOT to come back again for sure!\"  In other words, we all enjoyed our food (every dish went back to the kitchen completely empty) and we were satisfied with our experience, but it didn't send me over the moon.",

    "review": "Let me first state, I am simply blown away by the level of service, and care given to us by this restaurant. Specifically, Drew. My sister and her son needed to be at Seattle Children's for some advanced testing to determine what is causing my little nephews serious medical symptoms. This was no easy feat in simply getting to Seattle (out of state) getting admitted and settled into their room. So after literally hours of waiting they hadn't eaten in a while, and the food at the hospital is, well hospital food. I offered to buy my sister and nephew dinner. Something they would enjoy, and a little treat. She was elated for the lobster Mac and cheese, salad, rootbeer and for the little champ; chicken strips and fries. I called and Drew answered, and I inquired if they participated with ubereats or doordash. He said they are working on it, but- not at the moment. I was no doubt a little sad because- I'm in CA trying to coordinate feeding my loved ones, and it looked like it wasn't going to happen from this establishment. Drew asked: \"is there a way I can help?\" I just explained the above situation, and he offered to walk it over personally.  WHAT?! Wow. I was floored. So I order up what my family desired and Drew offered to add a slice of cheese cake, and as if that weren't enough- he said: \"you know what, I'm just taking care of the whole meal.\"  Insert jaw drop here. I literally was so taken aback I shed a few tears. It's so rare in our busy world that people - ORDINARY people- do something so genuinely kind, that has a lasting impact on complete strangers. My sister couldn't even believe it, and kept saying how overwhelming it is to receive such kindness, in the midst of her pretty rough day. She said the food was incredible. My nephew gobbled up the chicken strips and fries- she was in heaven eating the lobster Mac and cheese- but- the cheesecake? Ridiculously good she said. (She doesn't typically like cheesecake!) If you have the opportunity to dine here, please do. Drew, tonight you didn't just feed my loved ones, you single handedly changed their rough day into a great one.  I can't thank you enough for your kindness and generosity. Thank you.",

I chose to treat my family to dinner for my mom's birthday at JaK's dinner. Everyone was happy but most important Mom loved it. I typically order a Filet because they are consistently perfect and if they aren't then someone will correct it. They don't mess around when it comes to preparing a satisfying experience. Our service professional was Becca and she is an absolute doll. Gold standard over the top service gem. She was hustling all night but never once faltered from her devotion to our dining experience.  I had the Large Wedge with Salmon for dinner (it was twice as big as I could handle).   My son had the stuffed Halibut. It looked and tasted amazing. Mom has the pork chop. I think it was the biggest pork chop I have ever seen on a restaurant table. My daughter had their AMAZING cheeseburger. Always a winner. Mom's friend ordered the salmon. Full meal. Excellent tasting. We all shared the lobster Mac and cheese. If they could only make it fat free.

I've been to the West Seattle location more times than I can count, and also to the Issaquah location - both of which are great and reasonably priced given the high quality.You can't make reservations, so be prepared for a wait if you go during peak hours.For dinner: It's a steakhouse, so I recommend ordering a steak, but they do offer other types of meat and seafood. I've had most of the cuts and enjoyed them all. If you are looking for something different than just a steakhouse chop, I recommend trying the steak skewers. Each steak comes with a salad, steamed vegetables and a potato option - if you can't decide between potato pancakes and mashed potatoes then order a UFO which gives you both.Brunch:We are frequent \"brunchers\" here. All of the portions are really large and reasonably priced. So if you want to try Jak's on a budget this is a great option. I usually rotate between the Baja Scramble and a Classic Benedict, but I've enjoyed everything we've ever ordered.

Each time we've been, it has just been missing the mark and was never as good as we remembered.I must start off by saying the service is great, I love that it's a casual steak restaurant, the food is a good value, and there's a convenient parking lot in the back. I had debated between going to Jak's or Capital Grille, but wanted to support a local restaurant rather than a chain.Food wise, it was OK. When ordering a steak, it also comes with sourdough bread, salad, potatoes (of your choice) and veggies. I ordered the Seattle Ribeye which was a special of theirs at the moment (bone-in ribeye with caramelized onions and mushrooms on top) and my bf got the Jak's size filet mignon. I am no steak expert, I'm just sharing my humble opinion, but I think getting the larger filet mignon was a mistake. I think because the filet was such a thick cut of meat, getting it perfectly cooked in the middle without doing some damage to the outer layers was difficult. The filet was quite dry on the outter layers of the steak, even burnt at some parts. My ribeye was definitely the better of the two picks since it did not have that problem - the meat itself was thinner and had more fat and marbling to retain juices. The flavor of both steaks was just lacking something however. Both dishes also literally had half a head of cooked broccoli on the top which was a not worth the effort to cut down and eat. I had mashed potatoes which were fine (I wish there was gravy for it) and my bf had fries which were really good.We don't get steaks too often, usually when there is a special occasion, so it was a bummer that we both left feeling disappointed by Jak's.",

    "review": "Summary: quick wait times, cheap prices, small interiorCame on Monday at 8 (1hr before close) with a group of 5 and waited about 30 mins for a seat. The interior is rather small, they only have bar seating and tables for 2. I'd guess the restaurant seats about 20 people total. There are only 2 chefs cooking everything so it may take a bit for you to get your food. However, they will take your order outside while you are still waiting in order to be as efficient as possible. My group waited about 10 mins to get our food, but I saw some tables get their food immediately. I ordered the panang curry at lvl2 spicy, and shared the poor man noodle with a friend, also lvl2 spicy. The panang curry was amazing. The portion size was deceptively large, and by the time I finished I was already pleasantly full. The curry is very creamy and lvl2 was a comfortable spicy level where I could still fully enjoy the flavor of the dish. While they were the same spice level, the poor man noodle did not taste spicy at all. The poor man noodle is like a black bean pad thai, and in my opinion was a little too sweet. The noodles were much more firm than other thai places I've been to, which I enjoyed. The poor man noodle only comes with fried tofu, which was BOMB. It was crispy on the outside but still very soft on the inside.",

    "review": "It's an open secret that the best and most authentic Asian restaurants generally have two things going for them: lots of foot traffic and a 3.5 star yelp rating. Why is 3.5 the golden rating for great Asian restaurants? Because they get a bunch of 5 star ratings from people who know quality Asian food but also a good chunk of low ratings from Americans who tend to factor \"service\" and \"cleanliness\" way too heavily into their food experience. Thai Tom is a perfect example of this. Are they the cleanest establishment on the block? Far from it. Can the servers be a little rude at times. You bet. But their food is really really legit. I came back after first visiting here 6 months ago, and this time I got to try their noodle dishes. I'm giving it 5 stars for the Pad Thai alone. I also came back a third time for their pad see ew. That probably was a mistake (will explain later) - if you come here, get the pad thai. It's clearly their best dish. It's amazing, and I seriously question the taste buds of people who say otherwise. Anyways. Let's start with the noodles of the pad thai which is the star of the show. Comes out hot, chewy, and a little sticky. It's so balanced but explosive at the same time. All of the veggies in the dish are also so fresh: Bean sprouts, scallions, sweet radish, etc. Lastly the sauce of the pad thai was just perfect. The pad see ew was a little bit of a letdown in comparison. The sweet soy sauce they use is incredibly sweet - tasted like straight up honey to be honest. While it's still tasty and enjoyable, it is different than traditional pad see ew flavors so if you come here, order the pad thai!!",

    "review": "So many people have raved about this place so I decided to check it out. The restaurant is really tiny and there isn't a lot of seating space so when this place gets busy, the line is out the door. Knowing that, my husband and I decided to get their early and order takeout. We got to the restaurant around 6pm and lucky for us, there was only one person in front of us. We quickly checked the menu and decided on a chicken pad thai and chicken pad see ew. She asked if I wanted rice on the side which I thought was weird because I've had thai MANY times and never has it came with rice. I asked if the dish came with rice (because why else would she ask) but of course just as I suspected, it didn't so I declined. I guess it's just a way to sneakily charge people for more stuff? No clue. Anyways, we got our food after about 20 minutes of waiting and headed home.I opened my take out container and I immediately thought... wow is this some cruel joke!? The pad thai was the worst pad thai I've ever had. A chunk of my noodles were burnt and stuck together. The chicken was extremely overcooked, hard, and just plain inedible. Pieces of burnt egg were hidden underneath other pieces. Just a bunch of burnt pieces everywhere, it was an absolute mess. To top it off, I found a piece of plastic from a plastic bag in it as well. I couldn't even salvage the meal if I tried. If I had received this while dining in, I would've demanded a refund and walked right out. Keep in mind, this place wasn't even busy when we were there so I don't understand why or how my food was so burnt. I truly don't understand how anyone could have had a 5 star experience here. Needless to say, I ended up ordering thai at a much more reliable place. I'd advise you to save your money and do the same.",

I wondered if my peers and I were thinking along the same line, that this place is an embarrassment to Thai food. As I am typing this review, we are leaving to pickup additional Thai from Djan Thai, a vastly superior Thai restaurant, to wash out the stink that is Thai Tom.I read Young N's stellar review of this establishment from four months ago. While I agree with him on certain aspects, such as service shouldn't always factor into a star rating, I highly disagree with his assessment of the Pad Thai. If the food was taken out or the food is just so freaking good, ala Seinfeld's Soup Nazi, then service shouldn't be taken into account. Alas, Thai Tom is no Soup Nazi. My wife and I ordered a chicken Pad Thai and a chicken Pad See Ew, respectively. My Pad See Ew was extremely oily and there were burnt flecks throughout the whole dish. My wife's Pad Thai was bland and burnt, I would say approximately 1/5 of the Pad Thai was burnt. Thai Tom also tried to cover up the burnt parts by putting it underneath the non-burnt noodles. I'm guessing integrity isn't their middle name.Again, come here for burnt and oily food. Actually, don't. I warned you. Food 1/5 (the same amount of burnt food in the Pad Thai, what a not so happy coincidence)",

No, dude, that's obviously not the case as with the table that came in after us.It's just overall a crappy dining experience with okay food and the inconvenience of having to pay cash too!!

But multiple people had strongly recommended us to try them out, plus our friend who was researching Thai food in Seattle was also being pushed by his friends and family to check out Thai Tom. The strong recommendation piqued our curiosity.All of us are from Asia country and we are well familiar and have had experiences with some of the best \"street food\" that only cost like pennies. In our mind, that was what Thai Tom probably is. We got here on a Wednesday at around 6:30pm and there were several couples sitting at the tables already but the bar was still empty. The lady greeted us and seated us at a prime spot at the bar, right by where the cooking show took place so we were ecstatic. We got to feel the heat from the flaming woks, right where the spices and the chili assortment too, being able to watch the cooks cooking in all 6-8 woks all at once, throwing spices into the woks, throwing eggshells into the bins next to the stoves, fast motions and cooking endlessly and tirelessly. People kept coming in, and within 3 minutes of us sitting down, the place was completely packed, phone never stopped ringing for takeout orders either while the line was forming outside. All these built up an even higher expectation of what's about to go down lol. Our friend asked the lady for recommendation and we ordered their Shrimp Tom Yum, Thai Fried Rice with Chicken, Shrimp Pad Thai, Chicken Panang Curry, plus three Thai iced tea. She told us that they don't serve anything with pineapple and they only have shrimps from the seafood side, so there's no calamari, no mussels, etc. And yes they use MSG in their food, quite a lot of it actually.. we watched with our own eyes. Maybe we had built up certain expectation and excitement but we felt really underwhelmed with our food. The highlight of our meal was their Tom Yum soup which was very tangy and enjoyable, whilst our other dishes were very underwhelming. Although they had that charred taste, but they were overall lacking flavors and a little mushy. Our friend thought the fried rice was quite good as well but nothing to write home about.With the queue waiting outside, do expect to be rushed out of the place to accommodate the line even when you're still working on your food. Our bill came about $53 so I wouldn't say that it's super cheap per se, and the portion here is just about right but not abundant by any means. But one thing that I must admit. I kind of enjoy the vibe, reminds me a lot of Asia... how hectic it was with the staff preparing the foods, the noises, and the customers waiting patiently for their food while enjoying their drink. However, if you think this place offers great Thai food, then you kind of have missed out. Thai Tom is a mere Thai fast food joint at best.",

The ones we tried were all good! Most were pretty mild and not super briny. They were all wonderfully fresh and not fishy at all. My favorites were the Skookums which tasted sweet and scallopy!

Maybe this normally is? Maybe it was forgotten? But looked like a super easy way.

Absolutely breathtaking view. Can't wait to come back!",

It's a beautiful restaurant inside and out with a great view of the city. We all loved it up until it was time to pay the bill for a party of 12 people of $1,000.  What's the issue? (Other than one order of chips and dip costing $16) The staff made us put our names next to every item we ordered and then had us just write dollar amounts down of how much to pay per card and run the card up to the server. You would think that in 2019 at an upscale restaurant there would be an app or automated service of some sort to do the work for the guests and/or the employees?It took us all nearly 20 minutes to figure everything out and so when the waitress asked me how much to put on my card i told her for whatever I ordered....that seemed to put her in a tail-spin and looked at me as if I had three heads.  Well by no surprise she asked if I wanted to leave a tip and I said, \"sure, round to the nearest 10th\".  I'm sure you can imagine the look on the staffs faces at this point.",

Decided to back track from Lake City late this Sunday afternoon, and head back to the UDistrict for some quality wings from Bok a Bok Fried Chicken (9/8/19). Turns out this was only Day 4 of service,  so very new at a former pizza spot.Friendly person at the window who took my  order of 20 wings, with four sauces. A pair each of 4 Chili Hot Sauce and Sesame Soy Garlic were my choices. Had a brief wait, took Yelp photos, and talked briefly about the Seahawks with another customer. Soon with my takeout bag of goodness in hand, drove back to Shoreline.Tasty, crispy, plump, juicy wings were still hot once arrived at home! Delicious. With tax and tip, this order was under $29. There are other Bok a Bok locations in Burien, White Center, Seattle/Capitol Hill, and now this walk up takeout window in Seattle/University District up at 52nd/UWay with a convenient adjacent tiny parking lot. Hopefully, another one can open in North Seattle or Shoreline. Until then, yay for this site opening. They have ample time to adjust to their new digs before the onslaught of UW students starting end of this month.",

Upon arrival, the order was first come first serve basis and there was only one person in front of me at lunch time. It did not take them that long to make my order which was a 5-piece chicken drumsticks and a side of biscuit drizzled in honey.Personally, I think 5 drumsticks was too much for a person because they were HUUGEE but they were delicious and fairly priced. I spent around $17 dollars for my order but the amount of fullness I get was unparalleled. Food wise, their fried chicken was american and asian inspired since the breading was different and I would describe to have a texture of chicken karage. The chicken was awesome but I did not like the biscuit at all since they were very bready and dry. I would probably try another sides if I am ever coming back.",

They just need a bit of time to work some of the kinks out, but I'll still be coming!I ordered the bulgogi chicken tacos, and it was only okay. To be fair, they're more known for fried chicken, but I didn't want anything too heavy. I am curious to try their fried chicken sandwiches! Anyway, back to the tacos. The tortillas were a bit too thick for my liking and the sauce was a bit salty. The other filling was really good! The lettuce was fresh and had a nice crunch to balance the soft tortilla and tender chicken. It's really just the flavor of the sauce and the tortilla that didn't make this taco so good.Right now the rating is how it is when it first opened, but I'm sure it'll get better as they learn with this opening period. I'll come back a couple more times to try their other, more well-known items, but as of right now, this place is only alright.",

The sauces aren't my absolute favorite, but they get the job done. The sandwiches are good too - occasionally they overdo the amount of sauce on the sandwich, so it ends up being too salty, but it's usually not a problem. The only thing is that they do have a tendency to get backed up with orders, so expect to wait for your order if you don't order ahead of time. For the most part - the people their are also very nice and helpful, there have only been a couple of workers there that may be a bit standoffish but not rude or anything.
