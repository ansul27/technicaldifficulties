"1","121","I had the most wonderful experience at this restaurant! Tim, the owner, had an excellent wine special by the glass that paired perfectly with my starter of  meatballs in a hearty marinara sauce.  The meatballs were so delectable! I appreciated the option of more Parmesan, fresh cracked pepper and red chili flakes throughout my meal as I like things a little spicy. For the next course I had the Pomodoro Caprese and the tomatoes tasted so very fresh! The mozzarella, olive oil, balsamic and basil were top quality which all together made this delicious!For my main course I had the Carbonara and if you are a fan of this creamy pasta dish with egg and panceta it does not disappoint. To finish off my meal I had the in house made tiramisu and some limoncello.  It was the perfect ending to a perfect meal. Tim and his staff have definitely got the right vibe in this Ristorante Italiano with great conversation, fantastic wine and food and a comforting overall ambience.  I will be back!","5","10/16/2019","121","Brunello Ristorante","186 reviews","7115 Roosevelt Way NE","Italian","http://yelp.com/biz/brunello-ristorante-seattle","4"
"2","121","We celebrated our friend's birthday here for dinner last weekend. The restaurant was able to accommodate our large group fairly well.I enjoyed the burrata appetizer - it was my first time trying burrata, and I thought it was good (though I have nothing to compare it with). I ordered the pasta special of the night, and got to try a little bite of my friends' pasta dishes. For all the pasta dishes I tried, I think they were good but not particularly amazing.What stood out for me the most was Tim, who served us that night. He was extremely energetic, joyful, quick, and funny. He handled our large group with grace. I really appreciated the extra effort he put into giving us a positive experience!","4","11/7/2019","121","Brunello Ristorante","186 reviews","7115 Roosevelt Way NE","Italian","http://yelp.com/biz/brunello-ristorante-seattle","4"
"3","121","Had a weekday dinner here, based on reviews from other Yelpers. We were not disappointed. The menu had a great selection, and the food we ordered was tasty. I had a vegetarian pasta dish and he had a seafood pasta special. The portion size is very generous for the amount of each dish. The wine menu was decent and the service was very good. Our only complaint was that the vanilla gelato tasted more like ice cream than actual gelato, so that was a bit frustrating.","4","10/20/2019","121","Brunello Ristorante","186 reviews","7115 Roosevelt Way NE","Italian","http://yelp.com/biz/brunello-ristorante-seattle","4"
"4","121","My husband loved his salmon pasta with lemon butter, capers and white wine sauce $29.  I had the lasagna but lil too cheesy and very little meat or marinara sauce to relish on $14.  The bread was actually bland but was improved by dipping it in balsamic vinegar and olio.  Yet, if their entrees are this delish, then the bread should match the food quality.  I highly recommend they try a better recipe or buy better tasting bread.  I am a bread fanatic and unwarranted and unofficial bread connoisseur so if I dont like the bread, then the rest of the meal we be subpar automatically.","4","9/28/2019","121","Brunello Ristorante","186 reviews","7115 Roosevelt Way NE","Italian","http://yelp.com/biz/brunello-ristorante-seattle","4"
"5","121","April of this year when I went to Brunello. I had gnocchi with marinara sauce, which is one of my favorite dishes. It was delicious! I am all about sauce and this dish had it. The sauce was plentiful and tasty. The gnocchi was on point. If you're in the Roosevelt neighborhood, I would definitely make sure to give this Italian restaurant a try.Accessibility: This place is accessible. There are no steps to get in nor any booths to worry about. It will be a tight squeeze when it is busy though. The flooring is raised tiles so it may be bumpy for any wheelchair users. I do not remember the washroom situation. I would inquire.","5","10/15/2019","121","Brunello Ristorante","186 reviews","7115 Roosevelt Way NE","Italian","http://yelp.com/biz/brunello-ristorante-seattle","4"

"7","121","My Wife and I just got back from an Beautiful enjoyable evening here. The restaurant is very warm and pleasantly decorated and we enjoyed excellent service throughout our meal. The Prosciutto starter we got was phenomenal; salty and creamy and drizzled with a really beautiful olive oil. My Wife had the Frutti de Mari and we both agreed it was the best  food either of us had ever gotten. I went for A piece New York Steak, which was a bit of a gamble for me, since I often find Steak at restaurants to be a bit of a hit-or-miss situation. My wife loved his tiramisu, which is made in-house, and I enjoyed a really lovely bowl of spumoni. The  restaurant very good service.","5","11/13/2019","121","Brunello Ristorante","186 reviews","7115 Roosevelt Way NE","Italian","http://yelp.com/biz/brunello-ristorante-seattle","4"

"10","121","This place has become a fast favorite of mine! The service is absolutely amazing, the owner is super charismatic and takes the time to actually get to know his customers making the experience something else. The food is fantastic to boot! I especially love their homemade Gnocchi Gorgonzola.","5","10/1/2019","121","Brunello Ristorante","186 reviews","7115 Roosevelt Way NE","Italian","http://yelp.com/biz/brunello-ristorante-seattle","4"
"11","121","The Gorgonzola penne is the BEST and that is all. Yelp needs me to write more - but truly, just have that. it's salty, creamy, heavy, hearty and so damn decadent.

"12","121","A lovely neighborhood Italian restaurant. String lights outside and a rustic Italian feel on the inside. The staff is always very attentive. I've been here twice for date night and enjoyed all the dishes I had  - Gorgonzola sauce pasta and the seafood pasta special were both a delight!  They bring out a nice basket of bread which tastes great. My seafood dish had plenty of seafood which made me happy. :)","4","9/11/2019","121","Brunello Ristorante","186 reviews","7115 Roosevelt Way NE","Italian","http://yelp.com/biz/brunello-ristorante-seattle","4"
"13","121","I'm giving this place a 3.5/5 just by the food. It's a small mom and pops kind of Italian restaurant which kind of makes you feel at home. The staff and waiters are super friendly and will make sure your water is never empty! Spectacular service. It was nice of them to offer all the dinner specials in a very well manner. The food was just okay. I'm from Los Angeles and I was being too harsh comparing it to my favorite Italian restaurant back home. I got the spaghetti bolognese and fettuccini pesto. Both were a bit bland in my opinion. Meatballs were tasty though! Overall, this is a nice date spot! They have plenty of wine options as well. Bye Seattle!","4","5/2/2019","121","Brunello Ristorante","186 reviews","7115 Roosevelt Way NE","Italian","http://yelp.com/biz/brunello-ristorante-seattle","4"
"14","121","We love love love this quaint little neighborhood restaurant.  The staff aims to please and it has become our go to for big visiting groups and small intimate dinners.  There us something on the menu for everyone even the most careful eaters.  Their homemade gnocchi with Gorgonzola is to die for as are the garlic prawns. They also have a great and interesting wine selection.","5","10/18/2019","121","Brunello Ristorante","186 reviews","7115 Roosevelt Way NE","Italian","http://yelp.com/biz/brunello-ristorante-seattle","4"
"15","121","Okay, on the real, I want the homemade gorgonzola gnocchi with grilled chicken to be the last meal I have before I die.  For me to feel this way about an Uber eats delivery meal, makes me wonder about how much better this meal still could've been had I eaten in house. I think I would have just died in my seat at the restaurant had it tasted any better than it already did....I mean, my life would've been complete at that point.  In case you need any more perspective, I'm laying in bed at 6am writing this review, and I'm seriously counting down the hours before this little piece of heaven opens back up, so that I can re-order something else.  I can't speak about the service, or the ambiance of the restaurant and it's not like their delivery packaging was super posh or anything, in fact it came in what looked like a bodega plastic bag, but none of that was relevant to how amazing this pasta dish was. And I'm guessing from the other yelp reviews, that both service and ambience are also above average, and I. Cannot. wait. to go in and find out for myself. If you do not try the this place, than I don't know what eto say to you other than, your simply not living your best life.","5","7/21/2019","121","Brunello Ristorante","186 reviews","7115 Roosevelt Way NE","Italian","http://yelp.com/biz/brunello-ristorante-seattle","4"
"16","121","I live a few blocks from Brunello and have been three times in the last month. Stumbled across the place with my parents one Saturday evening when moving into my apartment and hungry from assembling furniture all day. All three visits were fantastic; outstanding food (Carbonara, Spaghetti Vongole, Penne Vodka all some of the best I've ever had), great service, and amazing hospitality from everyone up to the owner himself. Food and wine are priced at an extremely desirable and reasonable price point for the serving sizes and quality of food. All three times I have been to Brunello I have arrived on a weekend or Friday evening during peak time and never waited for a table. Loving what this restaurant does and looking forward to being a regular here. 10/10.","5","8/10/2019","121","Brunello Ristorante","186 reviews","7115 Roosevelt Way NE","Italian","http://yelp.com/biz/brunello-ristorante-seattle","4"
"17","121","Decent Italian fare near UW. Went with a couple of friends early evening. The place was nearly empty, perhaps owning to the time. We sampled pizzas, pastas, and some appetizers. Being from NYC, I'm spoiled when it comes to Italian food. This place is pretty typical of what one would find in most cities. Because we practically had the place to ourselves, service was quick.","4","10/20/2019","121","Brunello Ristorante","186 reviews","7115 Roosevelt Way NE","Italian","http://yelp.com/biz/brunello-ristorante-seattle","4"
"18","121","I had been at the restaurant that used to be in this location. It was also Italian. That was as much as I can remember about it. Other than that, I don't quite remember how the food or service was.My husband and I had an impromptu date night. We wanted to go to the Crest, but we wanted to eat out before the movie. I suggested this place because I had a hankering for pasta.I tend to expect neighborhood joints to be good at best. And that's sometimes okay if you're, like us, hungry and desperate.Look, I'm not saying this like being in Italy. But the food was pretty good. I generally don't love Italian-American cuisine because it tends to be too cheesy. This place served food that was between Jersey Italian-American and artisanal regional Italian cuisine if that makes sense. Like they at least have the decency not to batter and fry their calamari... But they do have your heavy sauces if you want your pasta that way. We enjoyed our pasta dishes and the service was very warm. It's not the cheapest meal but was quite reasonable everything considered.For specifics: I'm not sure how I feel about the bread. It's served warm (which was fantastic!) but I just wish it has a little bit more crust and bite. The pasta we had was al dente and the sauces had a pretty good balance. I ordered the penne vodka while my husband ordered the linguini vongole. The penne vodka was good but was missing... Something. I asked for a side of parsley and was given some chiffonade basil lol that actually worked! It just needed a little brightness to balance the heavy creaminess of it. My husband enjoyed his dish but said it was also missing something. It was just a little bit of sauce.Overall, we would come back.","4","3/27/2019","121","Brunello Ristorante","186 reviews","7115 Roosevelt Way NE","Italian","http://yelp.com/biz/brunello-ristorante-seattle","4"

The spanish fly; the arugula and proscuitto combo is just perfect. Sharp taste from the arugula and fatty deliciousness from the pork make for the ultimate contrast.2. Floral essence complimentary water3. The best brunch around University of WashingtonReasons not to go...1. You don't like biscuits? But who doesn't like a perfectly fluffy biscuit???????Three takeaways/tips...1. A quick gourmet biscuit sandwich that is unbeatable and on the fly.2.

"22","122","Though I loved Morsel the first time I visited, I'm afraid that I won't be returning until crowd control issues are addressed.This past weekend, my partner came to visit me in Seattle. His one request was going back to Morsel to get the biscuits and gravy that he gotten during his last visit. When we arrived at about 9:30AM on Sunday, we were surprised to see a long line that stretched outside, but figured it would move pretty quickly given that Morsel is a fast-casual restaurant. We were wrong. Despite the fact that the line was only ~15 people, it took us 40 minutes to order. This included about 25 minutes of waiting outside in the cold. When we finally reached the counter, we realized that the line was so delayed because the staff were halting orders until additional seating opened up. While I understand the value in doing this, it was not done effectively. There were multiple customers who overstayed at their tables after already consuming their meals. While we waited in the cold for 25 minutes, a customer sat inside working at a laptop, and another sat inside reading a book. Though we arrived at 9:30, we were not able to order until 10:10. Due to another engagement at 10:30, we ended up having to order our biscuits to-go and my partner was unable to have the biscuits and gravy that he had been craving.Disappointing.","2","11/5/2019","122","Morsel","961 reviews","5000 University Way NE","Coffee & Tea","http://yelp.com/biz/morsel-seattle","4"
"23","122","I never thought biscuits could taste so good!!! I was looking for breakfast places in the area and saw this had pretty high reviews and it was next door to YiFang Tea, which I thought was perfect because I wanted to try there afterwards. Is that a sign or what? Their menu was simple: Choose a biscuit and the filling you want OR you can choose a biscuit sandwich. I decided to get the Spanish Fly on a Chive Cheddar Biscuit and share the Biscuits & Gravy with Sun Dried Tomato Basil Biscuit with my friend. Their prices already include tax, how convenient Once you order, that's when you can grab a table. It gets pretty packed but people eat fairly quick so you easily grab a table. They call your name and then you grab your food. It looks and smells so amazing but that first bite of the sandwich, holy smokes, it was so delicious! I loved everything about it but I think what really made it so addicting was the pepper aioli that tied all the ingredients together. The Biscuits & Gravy was good as well but I would definitely come back for that sandwich. Oh how I wish we had something like this back in Hawaii","4","10/8/2019","122","Morsel","961 reviews","5000 University Way NE","Coffee & Tea","http://yelp.com/biz/morsel-seattle","4"
"24","122","While we were waiting for A recent appointment at a nearby hospital, we decided to go grab a lunch on the go. We've been eyeing this place for sometime and we're glad to finally get a chance to check it out!Located on University Way, just north of 50th, it is easy to get to as just about anywhere else on the Avenue.There's a good amount of parking out front, including some 15 minute parking which means you can usually find somewhere to park - big plus!The primary offerings here are biscuit centric and are downright awesome! They have standard biscuits like buttermilk and cheddar chive, as well as specialty ones. It was unclear to me if they were changing every day or just intermittently, either way they were awesome! We ended up getting the fast break on a cheddar chive biscuit and a daily special which included egg, a marinara type sauce and cheese on a pepper biscuit. I got both of them to go in the additional few minutes of marinating in their own juices need him even more delicious!I grabbed an extra normal buttermilk biscuit because we felt like we needed to try it - right choice!Call folks working here are super laid-back and the place is got a really chill vibe to it. It's great to dine in or take stuff to go, either way you will leave happy!If you're in the university district and need something for breakfast, brunch for whatever you enjoy biscuits, this is definitely a place you should try!","5","9/30/2019","122","Morsel","961 reviews","5000 University Way NE","Coffee & Tea","http://yelp.com/biz/morsel-seattle","4"
"25","122","I stopped by Morsel for a quick breakfast with a friend and loved it! We came in early on a Friday morning right about opening and were greeted with the intoxicating scent of biscuits.We both ordered the Spanish Fly and were very happy with it. Two perfectly crispy and soft biscuits with prosciutto, a fried egg, manchego, and arugula sandwiched in between. In fact, my largest complaint was that I could barely fit my biscuit sandwich in my mouth! The sandwich was perfectly balanced in flavor.Would definitely come back again for more biscuits! As an added bonus, they also compost so that's super neat.","5","9/18/2019","122","Morsel","961 reviews","5000 University Way NE","Coffee & Tea","http://yelp.com/biz/morsel-seattle","4"
"26","122","This is such a good place for a quick snack or breakfast. The portion sizes are perfect and the service is fast.I got the cheesy biscuit with Mama Lil's Peppers biscuits. It was SO good... the Beecher's cheese just tastes amazing. What an amazing choice of cheese!!! The garlic butter is so rich... The biscuits are so soft, fluffy, and flavorful... It was perfectly seasoned and balanced. The housemade tomato jam is also a nice topping! I also had a bite of my girlfriend's "The Fast Break" and it's really good. The bacon and egg go well with the biscuit. I don't think you can go wrong with any of the options here, but my favorite for now is the cheesy biscuit.","5","9/30/2019","122","Morsel","961 reviews","5000 University Way NE","Coffee & Tea","http://yelp.com/biz/morsel-seattle","4"
"27","122","Sweet location with easy street parking on a summer weekday and even better that one doesn't need to pay.  I love the open interior and the booths.  It is great that they have a gluten free biscuit option and my little person really enjoyed it.  The goat cheese sandwich was delectable and added an egg.  If I was attending school here I would be stopping here weekly!","5","7/22/2019","122","Morsel","961 reviews","5000 University Way NE","Coffee & Tea","http://yelp.com/biz/morsel-seattle","4"

If you're not a biscuit fan this is definitely a game changer! Biscuit itself was not dry at all, it was very flavorful and the have a variety of sweet and savory biscuits and sandwiches. The teas were alright as well. we got the first two sammies on the menu: the fast break and spanish fly! Then we got a regular buttermilk biscuit with chocolate hazelnut butter (tasted like melted ferrero! omg that was such a treat!!)

"31","122","My biscuit was almost cold which is really offputting to me. I didn't think it was extremely flakey or buttery either which are key qualities of a biskit. Tbh Seattle biscuit company is much better, and their jam is better too.  I got the cheesy biscuit on top of a cheddar biscuit and idk how they got the cheese to melt but my biscuit was still cold. Also the tomato jam is like pizza sauce.

"32","122","Morsel has the best tasting biscuit breakfast sandwiches I've had in Seattle. Usually I get "The Fast Break" or "The Spanish Fly". While the biscuits aren't the greatest biscuits (they're not super fluffy), the overall sandwiches are very tasty when combined with the other ingredients.Food:- 5/5 "The Fast Break" $7.75: bacon, scrambled egg, cheddar & toasted tomato jam.

Their biscuits are delicious, there's a lot of space to do work and enjoy your food, and their coffee is also good!

"35","122","Amazing fresh biscuits: hot and fluffy and layered inside, crispy outside, great buttery flavor. Lots of biscuit flavors to choose from too like cheddar chive, buttermilk, and changing specials.I had the Spanish Fly on a regular buttermilk biscuit: prosciutto, fried egg, manchego cheese, arugula, and a great housemade pepper aioli (don't worry it's not too spicy and I don't like spicy food). This is my favorite breakfast/brunch sandwiches ever because the toppings were light and flavorful with the rich biscuit.","5","9/16/2019","122","Morsel","961 reviews","5000 University Way NE","Coffee & Tea","http://yelp.com/biz/morsel-seattle","4"
"36","122","Morsel is where to get biscuits on the Ave.  It's popular for their biscuit sandwiches, so I was happy to learn that while in the area for an early meeting, I was just blocks away from Morsel, in time for breakfast.  The location of Morsel isn't very spacious, so get here early for a place to sit if you wish to dine-in.  However, many people in line on a weekday were getting their orders to-go, including me.  I wouldn't recommend for large groups.  Menu is straightforward with different biscuit sandwiches, different kinds of biscuits and different toppings.  There was also biscuits and gravy, which I totally would've ordered had I dined in and wasn't going to a meeting.  Therefore, I ended up ordering The Fast Break, which resembles a standard breakfast sandwich with bacon, eggs and cheddar, with a tomato jam.  I have to say, I wasn't able to eat The Fast Break soon after it was made since I was scrambling for time.  But it was still good when I did end up eating it.  The biscuit, as it should be, was the best part.  And quite honestly, I would've been happy with just the biscuit, as it was fluffy, soft with crispy edges and since I ordered mine with the cheddar chive biscuit, it had tons of cheddar flavor.  I recommend for cheese lovers!  (I also love that you can choose any kind of biscuit for any sandwich here.)  The bacon and egg just added some protein and thought it was a large and filling sandwich.  However, I wasn't a fan of the tomato jam, as there was a sweetness to it that I thought distracted from the cheddar, bacon, and egg rather than complemented it.  Overall, Morsel is a solid choice for breakfast while in the University District, especially if biscuits are your jam.  For just a biscuit or for more of a meal with a biscuit sandwich, you can't go wrong at Morsel.  Plus, they have zucchini chocolate bread, which is some of the best I've had...just in case you need dessert.","4","5/2/2019","122","Morsel","961 reviews","5000 University Way NE","Coffee & Tea","http://yelp.com/biz/morsel-seattle","4"

"40","122","I love Morsel!! Best biscuit place in Seattle. I've tried the Fast Break at the old location, which was bombdotcom. When I went last year, they had moved further up the street, which caught my friends and I by surprise. I got the Spanish fly with the cheddar chive biscuit- soooo gooood. Friend's biscuit and gravy was totes delicious. Biscuits were crispy on outside and soft on inside.

"41","123","Hands down, the best place to eat on the Ave. Not just for Mediterranean food, but for all food. Everything we've ordered has been super flavorful & if you order an entree plate, most of the time it will serve as 2 meals since the portion size are generous. The hours are crazy, everyday from 11am to 2am, perfect for late night bites! What's even cooler is that, it's still good even when you're not coming in drunk hours. The nicest people works here and they have the best Greek fries, they use real yogurt and melt the cheese, not leave crumbles in it. It's soooo good, it melts in your mouth. Request to add the special seasoning to it!

Their meats are tender and juicy and all in all good eats. For around $10 you can get yourself a great meal. Only $1.50 to add drink and fries to any sammy. Their fries are standard krinkle cut. Nothing fancy but not terrible. The staff is always friendly and it's easy enough to place a to go order. I will note the place is not huge so if it's crowded it may be hard to find a seat.

"50","123","So I finally made my way back to Shawarma King after graduating UW, when my diet consisted primarily of Ave food. Before I went to the old location on the opposite side of the street (a couple blocks up) but this location was just as tasty. My boyfriend and I showed up around 1:30pm on a Friday and didn't have to wait in line. A handful of tables were occupied but it was relatively quiet. I went with my usual Falafel Sandwich (~$5.99) and it turned out even better than I remembered! The sandwich includes a warm pita stuffed with crispy on the outside, tender on the inside falafel (crushed garbanzo beans mixed with parsley, cilantro and spices) along with shredded lettuce, hummus, chopped tomatoes, pickles, parsley and tahini sauce. So. Much. Flavor! They asked if I'd like some spice and I said yes. I guess the red hot sauce is Sambal Oelek... similar to Sriracha but better in my opinion. I was able to devour the whole thing and felt satisfied but not overly full.My boyfriend ordered a Chicken Gyro Sandwich (at least I think that's what he got, ~$6.49) and claimed it was the best Gyro he had ever had. That sandwich includes roasted chicken with grilled onions and tomatoes, lettuce, parsley, tzatziki sauce and maybe pickles/cucumbers. Anyway. He also wanted an order of the Greek Fries (~$2.99) and enjoyed those as well. The Greek Fries are the zig zag fry variety topped with a creamy white sauce, feta crumbles, parsley and paprika... at least that's what it looked like ha. The fries themselves were on the pale end of the spectrum (I like them cooked up a tad longer) but he had no complaints. He had some of his sandwich leftover but it's definitely possible to finish both the sandwich and fries. To order, you walk in and tell the man behind the counter what you'd like to eat, then take a seat and pay at the counter when you're finished. The man behind the counter was nice and friendly, which is always appreciated!Honestly the biggest turnoff is the smell inside the restaurant. The casual, smallish space smells strongly of frat and human beings who haven't bathed in several months, but I guess that's not too big of a surprise given the location and affordable prices... which may or may not be a dollar or so higher (I got the prices from a photo of the menu boards here on yelp). I'd return again to enjoy a falafel sandwich, maybe to-go.

"55","123","Yummy Mediterranean food, with the friendliest employees on the Ave!We came to Shawarma King for dinner where you order at the counter and take a seat until it's ready.  Since we weren't sure what to order with the range of menu items Shawarma King offers, the employee smiled, gave us a menu and told us to take a seat and take our time.  It was a nice first impression.  My boyfriend and I decided to both order the Mixed Grill Special, which is one of the House Specials.  We both wanted to try the different kinds of meats the plate offers.  When we ordered upfront, the cashier warned us that it would take 30 minutes, which it did.  Everyone who ordered after us got their plates before us, so it gives you an idea that this particular plate takes longer to make with the three meats they cook.The Mixed Grill Special was a wonderful dinner!  In addition to the three meats: beef kofta, lamb and chicken, there was rice, hummus, salad and pita bread.  It was certainly a large plate, so would recommend for anyone who's super hungry!  Of all the meats, I actually liked the beef kofta the most, with the herb seasonings.  And you could tell it was freshly housemade.  The chicken was also super tender and had a nice hint of lemon flavor to it.  The lamb was not bad, yet it was overcooked, so was a little tough on the texture - but not overly so where it was hard to eat.After you're done with your meal, you pay at the counter where the friendly staff asks how everything was.  I saw that with every person who walked in and out - the staff made sure to "hi/bye" everyone, no matter how busy the place got during the dinner hour we were here.  Especially since there were only two of them - I was impressed by how positive they were, making small talk with everyone who walked in.  Loved that!  This was a great, casual eatery for Mediterranean food on the Ave!","4","3/22/2018","123","Shawarma King","232 reviews","4337 University Way NE","Mediterranean","http://yelp.com/biz/shawarma-king-seattle-7","4"

The hummus came out on the side of our plate was something new. It had very creamy and soft texture which I loved it so much. I didn't like much of the salad dressing/falafel dipping.

"64","124","Summary: quick wait times, cheap prices, small interiorCame on Monday at 8 (1hr before close) with a group of 5 and waited about 30 mins for a seat. The interior is rather small, they only have bar seating and tables for 2. I'd guess the restaurant seats about 20 people total. There are only 2 chefs cooking everything so it may take a bit for you to get your food. However, they will take your order outside while you are still waiting in order to be as efficient as possible. My group waited about 10 mins to get our food, but I saw some tables get their food immediately. I ordered the panang curry at lvl2 spicy, and shared the poor man noodle with a friend, also lvl2 spicy. The panang curry was amazing. The portion size was deceptively large, and by the time I finished I was already pleasantly full. The curry is very creamy and lvl2 was a comfortable spicy level where I could still fully enjoy the flavor of the dish. While they were the same spice level, the poor man noodle did not taste spicy at all. The poor man noodle is like a black bean pad thai, and in my opinion was a little too sweet. The noodles were much more firm than other thai places I've been to, which I enjoyed. The poor man noodle only comes with fried tofu, which was BOMB. It was crispy on the outside but still very soft on the inside.","4","9/17/2019","124","Thai Tom","2148 reviews","4543 University Way NE","Thai","http://yelp.com/biz/thai-tom-seattle","3"
"65","124","It's an open secret that the best and most authentic Asian restaurants generally have two things going for them: lots of foot traffic and a 3.5 star yelp rating. Why is 3.5 the golden rating for great Asian restaurants? Because they get a bunch of 5 star ratings from people who know quality Asian food but also a good chunk of low ratings from Americans who tend to factor "service" and "cleanliness" way too heavily into their food experience. Thai Tom is a perfect example of this. Are they the cleanest establishment on the block? Far from it. Can the servers be a little rude at times. You bet. But their food is really really legit. I came back after first visiting here 6 months ago, and this time I got to try their noodle dishes. I'm giving it 5 stars for the Pad Thai alone. I also came back a third time for their pad see ew. That probably was a mistake (will explain later) - if you come here, get the pad thai. It's clearly their best dish. It's amazing, and I seriously question the taste buds of people who say otherwise. Anyways. Let's start with the noodles of the pad thai which is the star of the show. Comes out hot, chewy, and a little sticky. It's so balanced but explosive at the same time. All of the veggies in the dish are also so fresh: Bean sprouts, scallions, sweet radish, etc. Lastly the sauce of the pad thai was just perfect. The pad see ew was a little bit of a letdown in comparison. The sweet soy sauce they use is incredibly sweet - tasted like straight up honey to be honest. While it's still tasty and enjoyable, it is different than traditional pad see ew flavors so if you come here, order the pad thai!!","5","7/21/2019","124","Thai Tom","2148 reviews","4543 University Way NE","Thai","http://yelp.com/biz/thai-tom-seattle","3"
"66","124","OMG love this place!!! It was recommended to us while we were visibly Seattle, and it was soo good, we went there twice. We got the red curry twice, it was that delicious.

"67","124","So many people have raved about this place so I decided to check it out. The restaurant is really tiny and there isn't a lot of seating space so when this place gets busy, the line is out the door. Knowing that, my husband and I decided to get their early and order takeout. We got to the restaurant around 6pm and lucky for us, there was only one person in front of us. We quickly checked the menu and decided on a chicken pad thai and chicken pad see ew. She asked if I wanted rice on the side which I thought was weird because I've had thai MANY times and never has it came with rice. I asked if the dish came with rice (because why else would she ask) but of course just as I suspected, it didn't so I declined. I guess it's just a way to sneakily charge people for more stuff? No clue. Anyways, we got our food after about 20 minutes of waiting and headed home.I opened my take out container and I immediately thought... wow is this some cruel joke!? The pad thai was the worst pad thai I've ever had. A chunk of my noodles were burnt and stuck together. The chicken was extremely overcooked, hard, and just plain inedible. Pieces of burnt egg were hidden underneath other pieces. Just a bunch of burnt pieces everywhere, it was an absolute mess. To top it off, I found a piece of plastic from a plastic bag in it as well. I couldn't even salvage the meal if I tried. If I had received this while dining in, I would've demanded a refund and walked right out. Keep in mind, this place wasn't even busy when we were there so I don't understand why or how my food was so burnt. I truly don't understand how anyone could have had a 5 star experience here. Needless to say, I ended up ordering thai at a much more reliable place. I'd advise you to save your money and do the same.","1","7/29/2019","124","Thai Tom","2148 reviews","4543 University Way NE","Thai","http://yelp.com/biz/thai-tom-seattle","3"
"68","124","I just finished my takeout from Thai Tom, and with seething anger, I decided to check out some Yelp reviews. I wondered if my peers and I were thinking along the same line, that this place is an embarrassment to Thai food. As I am typing this review, we are leaving to pickup additional Thai from Djan Thai, a vastly superior Thai restaurant, to wash out the stink that is Thai Tom.I read Young N's stellar review of this establishment from four months ago. While I agree with him on certain aspects, such as service shouldn't always factor into a star rating, I highly disagree with his assessment of the Pad Thai. If the food was taken out or the food is just so freaking good, ala Seinfeld's Soup Nazi, then service shouldn't be taken into account. Alas, Thai Tom is no Soup Nazi. My wife and I ordered a chicken Pad Thai and a chicken Pad See Ew, respectively. My Pad See Ew was extremely oily and there were burnt flecks throughout the whole dish. My wife's Pad Thai was bland and burnt, I would say approximately 1/5 of the Pad Thai was burnt. Thai Tom also tried to cover up the burnt parts by putting it underneath the non-burnt noodles. I'm guessing integrity isn't their middle name.Again, come here for burnt and oily food. Actually, don't. I warned you. Food 1/5 (the same amount of burnt food in the Pad Thai, what a not so happy coincidence)","1","7/25/2019","124","Thai Tom","2148 reviews","4543 University Way NE","Thai","http://yelp.com/biz/thai-tom-seattle","3"

I've never had a waitress speak to me with her back turned.--The table that came in after mine got all their food, ate, and left before my table even got our food.--My friend got pretty angry with the waitress and complained about the wait. He sounded a little harsh, spoke to her in a voice that was too loud, but she wasn't apologetic at all and when she finally got our food, slammed the dishes on the table and scowled at us.--The other waitress who turned her back on me asked us what's wrong when we left and I told her the wait was too long and she got defensive and said every one had to wait. No, dude, that's obviously not the case as with the table that came in after us.It's just overall a crappy dining experience with okay food and the inconvenience of having to pay cash too!! The Pad Thai isn't even authentic because they didn't use garlic chives in the dish, instead it was green onions, lazy ingredient sourcing and unremarkable in my book.We didn't leave any tip.

The strong recommendation piqued our curiosity.All of us are from Asia country and we are well familiar and have had experiences with some of the best "street food" that only cost like pennies. In our mind, that was what Thai Tom probably is. We got here on a Wednesday at around 6:30pm and there were several couples sitting at the tables already but the bar was still empty. The lady greeted us and seated us at a prime spot at the bar, right by where the cooking show took place so we were ecstatic. We got to feel the heat from the flaming woks, right where the spices and the chili assortment too, being able to watch the cooks cooking in all 6-8 woks all at once, throwing spices into the woks, throwing eggshells into the bins next to the stoves, fast motions and cooking endlessly and tirelessly. People kept coming in, and within 3 minutes of us sitting down, the place was completely packed, phone never stopped ringing for takeout orders either while the line was forming outside. All these built up an even higher expectation of what's about to go down lol. Our friend asked the lady for recommendation and we ordered their Shrimp Tom Yum, Thai Fried Rice with Chicken, Shrimp Pad Thai, Chicken Panang Curry, plus three Thai iced tea. She told us that they don't serve anything with pineapple and they only have shrimps from the seafood side, so there's no calamari, no mussels, etc. And yes they use MSG in their food, quite a lot of it actually.. we watched with our own eyes. Maybe we had built up certain expectation and excitement but we felt really underwhelmed with our food. The highlight of our meal was their Tom Yum soup which was very tangy and enjoyable, whilst our other dishes were very underwhelming. Although they had that charred taste, but they were overall lacking flavors and a little mushy. Our friend thought the fried rice was quite good as well but nothing to write home about.With the queue waiting outside, do expect to be rushed out of the place to accommodate the line even when you're still working on your food. Our bill came about $53 so I wouldn't say that it's super cheap per se, and the portion here is just about right but not abundant by any means. But one thing that I must admit. I kind of enjoy the vibe, reminds me a lot of Asia... how hectic it was with the staff preparing the foods, the noises, and the customers waiting patiently for their food while enjoying their drink. However, if you think this place offers great Thai food, then you kind of have missed out. Thai Tom is a mere Thai fast food joint at best.","3","4/8/2019","124","Thai Tom","2148 reviews","4543 University Way NE","Thai","http://yelp.com/biz/thai-tom-seattle","3"
"77","124","Context:  Came here with a friend after having this restaurant recommended to me by multiple people.Atmosphere/Service:  The establishment is a tiny, dingy hole-in-the-wall, with barely any seating.  It's super hot and stuffy from all the cooking vapor, because the kitchen is located right in the middle of the restaurant.  You can hear sizzling of the stove and see the chefs stir-frying in front of you.  It's not the most comfortable restaurant, but what it lacks in aesthetic it makes up for in taste.  There's only a couple servers who will take your name down on a call list.  I recommend showing up and ordering take-out because it's faster.Food:  This is widely known as the best Thai food in Seattle (as shown by the accolades displayed on the window) and for good reason.  It's super authentic, and the flavors are strong.  The pad thai is the perfect combination of salty and sweet with tender, uniquely chewy noodles.  Final Thoughts:  This may be my favorite Thai restaurant in Seattle.  Definitely my go-to for take-out because it has never disappointed me!","5","8/26/2019","124","Thai Tom","2148 reviews","4543 University Way NE","Thai","http://yelp.com/biz/thai-tom-seattle","3"

I've had the phad Thai so this time I tried the tom yum... Medium spice was pretty spicy.. they load you up with tons of shrimp in it.

But we got so disappointed that the taste of the food was completely a total miss. Most of the dist was too sweet. Especially the Pad Thai and Drunken Noodle. Perhaps they got a new cook in this place. I would try again next time, but it's be my last shot.

"81","125","I have to respectfully disagree with Amanda S's analysis of the texture of the crepes. I was born in Beijing and ate through tons of JianBing in my childhood. The ones in Beijing were always soft and doughy. I didn't eat crispy and flakey ones until I started visiting Shanghai and to be honest, I didn't prefer that style. They seemed dry and didn't offer enough contrast from texture of the crepe and the crunchy filling inside. One bite into a crepe at BCZhang brought me back decades to my childhood.Now I have to say that it was quite pricey and I did not like how they put lettuce inside. I had to ask them to take out the flavorless lettuce but after my adjustment, the final result tasted quite excellent.","4","9/2/2019","125","BCZhang","45 reviews","4730 University Way NE","Chinese","http://yelp.com/biz/bczhang-seattle","4"
"82","125","These guys have no idea what they are doing lol. I didn't really feel like anything I've had in China but then again there are many many variations in China. I normally like crepes that are flakey and crispy and these ones were doughy and soft.I didn't really think the crepes tasted that great and watching the people struggle to make it made me lose confidence in their ability to get it right anyway. While I was waiting for my order, I watched the dude butcher 3 of them and have to start over because he coudltn flip it without tearing it apart. Which is also why orders were taking a hell of a long time. My girlfriend ordered the pot stickers and they came out of a frozen bag and they didn't even manage to cook them properly as all of the pot stickers stuck to the pan and came out all ripped up. I can make and cook much better pot stickers at home. I think they need to hire people who CAN cook or at least train them to cook before they start actually cooking for customers.","1","8/4/2019","125","BCZhang","45 reviews","4730 University Way NE","Chinese","http://yelp.com/biz/bczhang-seattle","4"
"83","125","Their crepe is packed with flavor and ingredients. I tried the wheat flour crepe beijing style which is meatless as well as the one with beef and wheat and green bean flour. Both are delicious and filling for just about 10$. They use roast beef and pickled radish as veggies. You can also adjust the level of spiciness from 1 to 5. I tried level 3 and it wasn't very spicy but had a kick to it. The place is big with a lot of seats. You order your food and get it from the counter. The decor is very simple and basic. Would definitely come back.","5","6/18/2019","125","BCZhang","45 reviews","4730 University Way NE","Chinese","http://yelp.com/biz/bczhang-seattle","4"
"84","125","A ok!! Big new spot. Interesting menu. The wait inside isn't great because it lack a good ventilation system. And they have savory crepes!! They have street style crepes and I wanted some. They do make it spicy. Everything from egg crepe to the special Beijing style crepe. Also have a buy one get one free offer on the door is misleading. Come inside for the full detailed explanation! You need 2 people to both come in between 11 am -7 pm!! Order crepes with drinks!! And put it on social media ( both) and after you can get one free Beijing style crepe. Or just ignore the offer all together! It's like IG give away but way more complicated!! But the crepes are huge!! You can use green bean or red bean crepe. I got the green bean with egg! Spicy! Not bad at all! Didn't care for the sourness in the filling. But crepe was good!!","3","3/6/2019","125","BCZhang","45 reviews","4730 University Way NE","Chinese","http://yelp.com/biz/bczhang-seattle","4"
"85","125","I never liked Chinese savory crepe after trying one that had a texture of a rubber toy but man BCZhang changed my experience! I came here on a Thursday afternoon and it wasn't too busy. They had a great promotion currently going on where you buy one crepe with a drink and get one free! So we ordered the beef savory wheat crepe and got the Beijing style crepe free! The Beijing style is basically filled with veggie and has crunchy wonton inside. Both were huge and very fulfilling! Ask for vinegar and spicy chili oil to enhance the flavor! Overall I liked the food and the employee was super nice, always checking in on us! Also if you order on Wali Seattle app and use my promotion "tinyhangrytiff" you can get a free marinated egg and soda with any crepe purchase!

"86","125","Interesting and extensive menu. It didn't blow me away, in fact I didn't really enjoy it. To be honest I was expecting something more differently rather than what taste like those packaged ham/beef you buy at Safeway to make sandwiches. Maybe I'm just not a fan of Chinese crepes but it didn't draw me to want to come back. One crepe is really filling though which is good! It is packed with meat, veggies and sauce(?). Customer service: 10/10. It was fast and easy. I came around 3pm on a weekday and was able to get my order within a couple minutes.","2","6/11/2019","125","BCZhang","45 reviews","4730 University Way NE","Chinese","http://yelp.com/biz/bczhang-seattle","4"
"87","125","Honestly not bad. People in China love to debate what should and should not be in savory crepes and what flour is the correct one. I grew up eating wheat crepes with random stuff like kimchi (not joking), but I know folks from Tianjin will never settle for anything less than green bean flour (and definitely no kimchi allowed. It's just sacrilegious to those people!)Well. No kimchi here (haha), but you wouldn't need to debate for anything else. They have all the options possible. Ham, chicken, beef, wheat, green bean, red bean flour, etc. I'm a huge fan of the spicy sauce. It's has a nice kick to it. It's pretty close to what I would usually have back in China. The store setting is a bit weird, and the packaging makes it difficult to eat without getting super messy. Honestly, tighter folding and a paper bag will do... and I definitely don't consider this as something you eat sitting down. A food truck is more than enough.","4","4/25/2019","125","BCZhang","45 reviews","4730 University Way NE","Chinese","http://yelp.com/biz/bczhang-seattle","4"
"88","125","I had the Beijing jian bing which was basically egg-laden crepe liberally slathered with sweet bean sauce and filled with a couple fried wonton wrappers. They don't even bring your food to your table.  The food was priced too high. Totally underwhelming.","2","6/3/2019","125","BCZhang","45 reviews","4730 University Way NE","Chinese","http://yelp.com/biz/bczhang-seattle","4"
"89","125","It is the closest I've had to the Beijing crepe in Seattle.  To be honest, I couldn't tell any difference between the green and red bean crepe.  From the pictures it looks like they were both red bean.  Also we ordered beef for both and one had ham in it instead.  I like that I can choose what type of crepe to get such as wheat, green and red bean.  The price of the crepe is higher than in Beijing at $10 a crepe of you want meat inside, $9 without any meat.  I would come here if I had a craving for Beijing crepes and couldn't make it to Richmond BC for more variations at a cheaper price.","5","2/27/2019","125","BCZhang","45 reviews","4730 University Way NE","Chinese","http://yelp.com/biz/bczhang-seattle","4"
"90","125","I chanced upon this place while making my usual bubble tea run and saw they make jian bing which is like a crepe with egg and salty toppings. I was so excited so my mother and I decided to try it. Upon walking in the restaurant was clean and smelled good. It is a standard size for university district spaces. Their menu is decent with multiple options. We ordered at the front and watched them make it. It was fun to watch them behind the counter. The restaurant provided utensils and even gloves to eat with your hands without soiling them. They were homey and kind in service. The crepe itself seemed good, crispy on the outside and soft and warm in the middle and the eggs were well integrated. The ham (which is what I ordered) looked good as well. However, they neglected to ask spiciness level and ours were much too spicy to consume. Thus, I would give them 4 stars. They seem to have potential but may not be my first option to eat at in the future. In summary, clean, decently priced, unique crepes, but very spicy.","4","1/28/2019","125","BCZhang","45 reviews","4730 University Way NE","Chinese","http://yelp.com/biz/bczhang-seattle","4"
"91","125","Really good! I got a beef crepe with wheat and green bean flour. I ordered it a 1 for spice (on a scale of 1 to 5) and it was plenty spicy. So be warned! Still super tasty and I'd be interested in coming back to try different types of crepes here again. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars was because it was kind of dirty inside (tables weren't wiped down, food gunk was smeared on the cash register) and because the crepes are served with a paper lining, but the steam from the crepe plus using a knife and fork rips the lining and then the paper gets mixed up with your crepe. Also the decor still looks weirdly unfinished. Which isn't a big deal, because the food is what really matters. But the ambiance could use a little work.","4","4/21/2019","125","BCZhang","45 reviews","4730 University Way NE","Chinese","http://yelp.com/biz/bczhang-seattle","4"
"92","125","I ordered two crepes with Chinese sausages, we end up having two crepes with ham. Besides of having wrong order, the crepe was way too salty. It was poorly wrapped, after couple of bites, the crepe falls apart. It gets really messy in my car. It's 10 dollars per crepe, I think it's kinda pricey for what we got. I'm from northern China, I can tell this is not authentic jian bing guo zi. Kinda disappointed for the first try, I probably will give them another try later.","2","7/21/2019","125","BCZhang","45 reviews","4730 University Way NE","Chinese","http://yelp.com/biz/bczhang-seattle","4"
"93","125","This is newly opened on the Ave and my friend recommended it to me. I checked it out on a weekend afternoon and it turned out to be a hidden gem. They offered different types of Chinese style Crepes, with various choices of meat and flour. I had the Beijing Crepe with spicy sauce, which was so authentic and yummy. Parsley, pickles, lettuce and etc were warped inside the Crepe, and there were scrambled egg, black sesame and green onions on the Crepe. There was a help-yourself table near the order counter with all the forks, knives, gloves and napkins. Nice place and look forward to trying what's coming next on their menu.","5","12/15/2018","125","BCZhang","45 reviews","4730 University Way NE","Chinese","http://yelp.com/biz/bczhang-seattle","4"
"94","125","Honestly, I wasn't quite sure what to expect as this was my first jianbing, but was pleasantly surprised. I got the Beijing style with the green bean flour (per the cashier's recommendation). I also asked for it to be a bit spicy which helped add some more flavor. There were lots of veggies and a crispy wonton in the middle, although overall it was kind of dry. The flavor was good, but it seemed like it needed some kind of hoisin sauce, but again, I'm not 100% sure how it's supposed to be eaten. Overall, the flavor was good and it was a nice snack! The prices seemed a bit steep for what it was though ($9 for one jianbing)The location is further up the Ave, right across from Ding Tea and the restaurant is pretty big and open.","4","1/18/2019","125","BCZhang","45 reviews","4730 University Way NE","Chinese","http://yelp.com/biz/bczhang-seattle","4"
"95","125","I LOVE northern Chinese style food and especially street food and was so happy to see a place like this open up in the U District. The menu can be a bit confusing at first, but is actually pretty straightfoward. Pick your crepe base, pick your meat (if desired). If you want to go with traditional style, then the Beijing Style crepe is where it's at--no meat. That's it. I'm not sure how differently the crepe bases taste, or if I could even tell. But that's not important. The important thing is that the crepe is delicious! Freshly made, warm, crispy, and with all the right flavors. Personally, I'm a meat lover and really enjoyed the beef. All in all, would come back again. It's a pretty new spot, and could use some more decor and menu development. But!

"96","125","They got some really good potential but current work needs a lot of improvement. First of all, the sauce isn't right, second, for 10bux I expect more quantity, not more meat, but at least more patty or vegies that can fill the belly at least. lastly, create better selections.

I noticed that there was only 2 people working and food was taking really really long to make, so i thought "aw that's cute they're a new place trying really hard with two people" -- cuz the entire restaurant in the first place wasn't even finished decorating. So they call her name (which they got wrong) and gave us our food so we eat it but after digging in for a while we realize it not our order?? So we ask if it's chicken but they were like no that's ham??? And this Caucasian (owner???) lady keeps saying my friend ordered wrong. She kept giving us this attitude and kept saying things to herself (that we can hear) to make my friend feel like she was the one at fault. We got NO APOLOGY what so ever. She didn't even tell us directly she'll remake the wrong item for us. She kept smiling and muttering to herself and this employee next to her -- soooo much passive aggressiveness. At this point she kept saying that they need to install a system where they can keep track of what the customers ordered..... so they have no idea what the customers ordered and we don't even get receipts. Like wtf??? ***Don't open a restaurant if you're not ready to give good service/give receipts of our order/have a system in place to keep track of what you're doing****At the end we told the lady we don't want it and we just left. We couldn't keep eating when the worker kept blaming my friend for ordering wrong (which she didn't. They just fucked up with NO ORDERING SYSTEM). The other innocent employee ended up apologizing to us. I told her it's not her apology to give and we left. Food: wasn't that bad actually. It was just mediocre. I think the reviews are overrated.

It was a convenient way to fresh eggy crepe while keeping hands clean. The ingredients within were crisp and plentiful, the green onion and lettuce along with the cracker inside were a nice bite.

With regards to what to order, I've been here a few times and always circle back to the tofu soup and suggest you do the same. A side meat dish is nice to have too - the bulgogi beef comes as a super generous portion size and is tasty as a supplement to the soup.

"103","126","Late Sunday night called for Korean cravings, which ultimately led us here. WAITIt was surprisingly busy at 8pm on a Sunday night, but it is in the U District, so there's a lot of college kids who eat later. We waited probably 10 minutes for a table. AMBIANCEIt really reminds me of Chipotle with the sheet metal and wood trim decor. Nothing amazing about the space, service is quick and too the point like most restaurants off the ave. FOODI went with the classic Bibimbap, and was a little disappointed. The flavors just weren't there, and I had to rely on a lot of gochujang to get something out of the dish. The ingredients weren't the freshest, but it was still alright. The banchan options were pretty limited as well. The pancake was stale and felt like it had been sitting out all day, and the kimchi wasn't great.Their Beef Soonduboo was good for the price. They're known here for their tofu soups, so I'd stick with those.OVERALLCome for the tofu soup, or if you're just really craving korean food.

"104","126","One of the best korean restaurants near UW! The prices are super affordable and comes with several side dishes. I got the squid sizzling stone pot bibimbap and it was $9.49 without tax (as of 11/04/19). When the squid bibimbap arrived it was hot and steamy and continued to do so throughout most of the meal. There was a good amount of squid and cut into a perfect size to chew on. It was tender and every bite was satisfying, making you want to keep chewing on and on. It's like the sensation you have when chewing boba. As for everything else, the vegetables and rice complemented the squid making it the perfect dish when craving something spicy on a cold day. For the flavor and taste I could only taste the spiciness and sauce but I was still satisfied. Bottom line: Good traditional korean restaurant that's cheap.

Taste for both is alright -- nothing terrible, but nothing to hit home about.Banchan is not always the freshest and pretty meh at best.

"106","126","Great place to go if you want a lot of food at an affordable price!Went here a couple of days ago to get some Korean tofu soup. I ordered the mixed tofu soup, and it came out quickly. Make sure you don't burn your tongue because it comes out piping hot. The server would plop a fresh egg into the boiling soup, so make sure to cover the egg with the tofu and other things in the soup to cook it enough. The mixed soup included beef, shrimp, and clams. However, the majority of it was tofu with 1 shrimp, 2 clams, and some sprinkling of beef. The soup was way too salty for my liking, and I got so full from eating the rice to balance out the saltiness.They also had a good amount of side dishes. The server brought out kimchi, bean sprouts, fish cakes, braised potatoes, and some chopped up green onion pancakes. You can tell these dishes came out from large batches because they weren't that fresh. The green onion pancakes were especially staler and cold.Service was not the best, but it's understandable because there were only 2 servers for a packed restaurant. I'd like to come back to try bibambop or bulgogi.","4","7/10/2019","126","Korean Tofu House","667 reviews","4142 Brooklyn Ave NE","Korean","http://yelp.com/biz/korean-tofu-house-seattle","3"

The Toppokki (cylindrical rice cakes) have a similar texture to mochi and are served in a super spicy and red Korean sauce. The dish also has a little bit of beef bulgogi, onions, and lettuce. Traditionally it is served with ramen on top (+$1), but I prefer mine without the extra noodles. The purple rice is complementary and is an absolute must in order to eat this dish.The Jap Chae (sesame oil glass noodles) is enough to serve at least 2-3 people.

It's not too loud in the restaurant even when busy.Service: Service was, interesting. The servers I've had were great. College kids mostly, one I ended up talking to who picked up the job as a summer gig. However, one server did tell me the manager was complaining that they were serving too many side dishes, which is a major red flag.Food: The food is decent. The prices were actually really fair, better than the other tofu house across the street. My favorite were the side dishes. They have a really tasty pancake dish that my friend and I asked for tons of extras for, as well as the savory potato dish that's pretty rare to find at Korean restaurants nowadays.Overall I've had great experiences eating here and would definitely recommend checking this place out.","4","8/12/2019","126","Korean Tofu House","667 reviews","4142 Brooklyn Ave NE","Korean","http://yelp.com/biz/korean-tofu-house-seattle","3"
"109","126","All the tofu soups are priced at $8.99!! Ordered the mixed (beef and seafood) extra spicy. Came with refillable purple rice & side dishes -- loved the kimchi.

"110","126","I had their mixed tofu soup and it was hands down way better than Kong and the other Korean restaurants I had before. The side dishes were okay and the only thing I liked was the potatoes those were 5/5. The only thing I would be slightly concerned about is the cleanliness cause a big juicy fly landed on one of the side dish while we were eating and that was kind of horrifying.","4","11/6/2019","126","Korean Tofu House","667 reviews","4142 Brooklyn Ave NE","Korean","http://yelp.com/biz/korean-tofu-house-seattle","3"
"111","126","Came here on a busy Sunday afternoon. We walked in and luckily a small table for 2 just finished so, we were seated right away.  The server handed us a menu, although it was one-sided, surprisingly they had quite a selection. Their dishes ranged from spicy tofu soup to Bulgogi to yukgaejang to bibimbap.It was a cold frosty day so we both decided on spicy tofu soup, one pork and the other seafood. We also ordered japche as well. The servers brought us some panchan; kimchi (wasnt done yet), chives pancake (cold and not crispy), sweet potatoes (delish), fish cakes (yum) & bean sprouts (not bad) - 3 stars.After snacking on those side dishes for a few mins, our tofu soups came out bubbling hot. The server also brought out a couple eggs & cracked them right into our stone pot soups. The soup was spicy and delicious! It totally hit the spot - 5 stars!The japche finally came out after a handful of mins. At first, we couldnt really taste anything but more of just a sweetness. Then we realized it's because we have been eating the super flavorful tofu soup so, it made the noodle dish bland in comparison. So, we decided to pack the japche up and try it again later. Sure enough, the japche was definitely tastier the 2nd time around with our palates cleansed and tastes buds back to normal - 5 stars.Overall, I'd give this spot 4 stars. Service was on point and prices were fair. Looking for street parking was no fun. Main dishes were good; the side dishes can use some work. If I am in the area again, I'd like to come back to try other things on their menu.","4","2/5/2019","126","Korean Tofu House","667 reviews","4142 Brooklyn Ave NE","Korean","http://yelp.com/biz/korean-tofu-house-seattle","3"

An Asian guy worked in front alone, he was very rude. When he took us to the table, he threw the menu on the table and walked away. Are you kidding me? I was there to buy food, not to ask for a free meal. If you really hate your job or something happens to your life, take a day off man or quit the job. He even said F*** when he walked pass us. If the restaurant still keep this guy around, I'm sure they will keep loosing more customers. The person next to us agree that the service was terrible and rude. I would not surprise that a couple walked out the restaurant after sitting down for a few minutes. I wanted to leave after saw them walked out, but I was too hungry to go find another place.It wasn't my first time eating here. Back in the day, the service was great. Today, the service went downhill. I would not come back even the foods are goods.

It clearly states that the restaurant is open until 9 pm and we went in around 3:30-4:00. The guy at the reception was very uncomfortable conveying this message and apologized . No one else was asked to leave the restaurant. It's sickening that people behave this way in 2019. Never entering that place again.

I love the no frills interior, because I really only come for the food. It's SO good and super affordable. Always generous portions of delicious banchan to share, speedy delivery of food, and great portions for the price. I'm very obsessed with the tofu dumpling soup - super spicy broth filled with lots of plump dumplings and silky tofu? Uh yes, get in my belly. We also always get the green onion and seafood pancake to share along with the bulgogi. Their bbq dishes are equally delish. I love this restaurant and will always eat here when I'm in the U district.

"119","126","I've heard from my Korean friends that there is no good Korean food on the Ave and I have yet to prove them wrong. I ordered the mixed tofu soup with beef, clams, shrimp, and oyster. Mixed tofu soup, soondubu, is one of my favorite dishes as it really warms the soul. I've had authentic soondubu before in Annandale, NYC, and Seoul. This is by far the saddest soondubu experience I've had unfortunately. The soup didn't come out hot and could barely cook the egg that we cracked into it, although I know some people prefer runny yolk. When my friends and I commented on how lukewarm our soups were, a woman at a neighboring table also chimed in and said she'd observed that too and was glad others agreed. The soup was sadly very watery and thin! The rice (they give purple rice with the soup) is on the stiff side. Side dishes were alright except the pajeon (Korean savory pancake) was straight up cold. But on the plus side, the service here is good. The staff is very friendly and quick to bring banchan refills. Likely won't be coming back here given the experience with the food.","2","12/27/2018","126","Korean Tofu House","667 reviews","4142 Brooklyn Ave NE","Korean","http://yelp.com/biz/korean-tofu-house-seattle","3"

The flavour was decent and the side dishes were tasty especially their kimchi but it was not the best tofu soup I have had to date. What definitely diminished my experience at this place was one guy who worked there who was a bit rude to me. Whenever I asked him for more side dishes or water it made me feel like as if I was a burden.

I should ask for the dressing on the side (tzaziki sauce), I usually feel refreshed eating gyro salads but this was one loaded with dressing and the meat was seasoned a little differently than what I'm used to. Don't get me wrong, the salad was good! But not as refreshing as I would like.

"124","127","This gyro/falafel joint seems to be a classic on the Ave for late night dining and for good reason too. They're open late into the night, serve greasy and good food fast and for a decent price. I ordered the lamb gyro with hot sauce and a side of falafel. The gyro meat was tender but the hot sauce was a little overpowering and the last few bites were a little soggy and full of the sauce and drippings from the meat. Overall I enjoyed the gyro.The falafel I got on the other hand was pretty dry and crumbly, inside had a nice texture of the lentils but I felt they fried it a little too hard. The side of white sauce didn't do much to combat its dryness. Overall it's a pretty good option for late night grub and I would eat here again.","3","8/12/2019","127","Aladdin Falafel Corner","425 reviews","4541 University Way NE","Mediterranean","http://yelp.com/biz/aladdin-falafel-corner-seattle-2","4"

Why, I even have servants who go to the falafel for my servants, so it couldn't have been me you seen at Aladdin Falafel Corner in Seattle, Wa"! On a dark, cold, and desolate night with barley enough strength to hold myself upright (possible due to being hangry and/or too much Hennessy) I stumbled upon a sign.. a sign light like a Casino.. but not a Vegas one, more like one you go to here (the ones you never really win at, but you go have the omelet bar your gam-gam). Having heard wonderers, wise men (women), and broke college kids whisper in the shadows that if you want lamb wrapped in carbs and drizzled with garlic yogurt this is this the place!! I immediately located my Bank app.. confirmed my fortune ($21.84) and entered the estiatório  (restaurant). The food: This was hands down the BEST gyro I've had in WA (Might be due to cooks being Turkish or Greek or just plain magic; i.e. it's uber authentic)!!! Even at night the food was fresh and piping hot like they had just cut it off the spindle (YUM). The toppings and sauce were all fresh and perfectly seasoned! While we didn't get any sides because we had planned on trying several different places, their greek fries looked and smelled tremendous! I will definitely be back!

"133","127","As much as it pains me, this experience was slightly below average. The original "Ave" spot down the way was a total staple in college and introduced me to the magic that is the Gyro! Seriously, it may be my favorite meat! That's why this was such a letdown.We wandered in as I was in a hangry state and wished to satisfy my cravings with the best meat since time started. The dudes working were super chill and took my order right away. It was out in a few minutes and the combo looked great. That's where it ended. The fries were unfortunately really bland. A little salt would go a long way. The gyro was served on an excellent pita but the meat was slightly cold and wasn't crisped at all. It was probably the least satisfying Gyro I've ever had and it made my heart sink a bit. I imagine they do better on a regular basis and had one aspect been off, I'd give them the benefit of my doubt, but when both items are sub par, well sir- the masses deserve to know.I truly hope my blah lunch was a dual misfire. Others seems to be enjoying their meals, though maybe they got something. We'll be heading down the street next time as no mediocre experience will deter us from the deliciousness that is the Gyro!","2","12/10/2017","127","Aladdin Falafel Corner","425 reviews","4541 University Way NE","Mediterranean","http://yelp.com/biz/aladdin-falafel-corner-seattle-2","4"

"140","127","[Ambiance] This place is quite a small place on the Ave, quite easy to miss. When you go in, there are a few tables where you can sit and dine in, although many people would take the food to go. During the night, the place gets quite crowded and you can observe a lot of drunk college kids waiting to pick up their food.[Food] Their food is phenomenal! I usually get a regular gyro or a lunch gyro dish combo and they are amazing. The meat is more flavorful and seasoned compared to other gyro places I have been to. I love how they fill the sandwich with enough tzatziki sauce that makes all the ingredients blend well together. Their lunch dish combo is a great deal, considering you can probably get your two meals out of one. [Price& Service] This place is very affordable. You'll pay between $6.50-$9.50 depending what you get. This place does not offer much service and the owners look very fatigue at times but you don't expect too much service going to a gyro place so you can definitely overlook that. Overall, I definitely recommend this place and this place goes on my *DIMELIST*.

"141","128","I stopped by for lunch as it is very close to the Health Sciences Building at UW. If you're in a hurry or want to skip the wait, they have a take out window. The tacos here are good, but nothing to write home about. I ordered 3 carnitas tacos and the pork was lukewarm and slightly dry but you can tell it had been seasoned well and would probably have been perfectly cooked if they had served it right away. I will say the quality of the rest of their ingredients were good and as tacos don't have many hidden ingredients, it's a great place to stop if you're looking for something on the healthier side. If you do go the take-out route, be sure to ask for extra salsa as they have them ready in small to go containers.","4","8/12/2019","128","Agua Verde Cafe","959 reviews","1303 NE Boat St","Mexican","http://yelp.com/biz/agua-verde-cafe-seattle","3"
"142","128","Food is alright, but the setting is wonderful!  I visited Agua Verde Cafe for lunch with my friend who works at UW, as this is her usual spot.  If only it was sunny when we had visited! For lunch on a weekday the place was pretty steady, but lots of seating was available, including the sunroom area, which had nice views of the water.  On sunny days they do have a patio area that's open, which is the best seating of the entire joint. When you walk in you order at the counter and are given a number, for staff to deliver food to your table.  They have the standard Mexican favorites, with a long list of different tacos.  While my friend ordered the fish tacos I ordered the nachos with carnitas.  Though on the menu it says you can add chicken to your nachos, you can substitute for another meat.  There's also a salsa bar here, with four different salsas.  Food didn't take too long to get.  My friend liked her fish tacos, which came with chips, so the salsas came in handy.  My nachos weren't horrible or anything, but they're not my favorite.  The queso was lukewarm, which is my biggest complaint, and the carnitas were slightly overcooked.  But everything else was fine.  The salsas added some necessary heat, even if the dish came with jalapenos.  I've had better nachos, but they weren't bad. Agua Verde Cafe serves average food, but I would come back, for the awesome setting.  Plus, they have happy hour and a full bar menu, with a marg with my name on it when I visit again when I don't have anything else to do that day!","3","10/19/2019","128","Agua Verde Cafe","959 reviews","1303 NE Boat St","Mexican","http://yelp.com/biz/agua-verde-cafe-seattle","3"
"143","128","I work closeby and stumbled into this cafe on a rare sunny day in Seattle this month with a friend. It was cold, and I only came in with the intention of grabbing some hot cocoa, but was surprised to see that their lunch menu was more extensive than I thought! They have cocktails, coffees/teas, tacos, quesadillas, burritos, and other rice dishes. Of course I took this as an opportunity to try out a couple of dishes for the Yelp community ;) My friend got the carnitas tacos and I ordered a mango quesadilla. For drinks we ordered a Mexican mocha and a chai (advice: the Mexican mocha was better). We got seated right by the water and had a beautiful view of the lake for lunch. The food overall was pricey for the portions, especially since there are so many other (more affordable) food options nearby on University. Despite the price, I'd say the taste was pretty good! My friend really liked the carnitas tacos, and she's from New Mexico, so I believe that gives her some credibility. My mango quesadilla was good as well, packed with more mango than I expected. There are huge bowls of self-serve salsa, and they are fantastic. Even though I didn't order it, I'd recommend ordering a chips and salsa plate if you come by here with the munchies. I saw a table nearby me order this dish and got a mound of chips (and unlimited salsa!). The staff were friendly and attentive, though everything was pretty much self-serve. The drinks were warm, and what I needed on the cold day, though the chai was more of a horchata than a chai. They also have a window out in the front of the restaurant to order coffee/drinks for people who are on the go. I've heard that you can also rent paddleboats/kayaks there (or maybe at a place really nearby?). Overall, the food was good and I would come back whenever I have some extra spending money and a hankering for some good Mexican mocha.","3","10/7/2019","128","Agua Verde Cafe","959 reviews","1303 NE Boat St","Mexican","http://yelp.com/biz/agua-verde-cafe-seattle","3"

Staff have always been friendly and relatively prompt, the views of the water are lovely (bonus if you get a spot on the heated patio in fall/winter!), and the fish tacos are hot, crispy, and served with the BEST sauce, along with yummy rice and beans that you can usually pack up to take home as leftovers (if you pace yourself better than I do).However, I will only go to Agua Verde for happy hour or dinner. After having multiple terrible experiences ordering my tacos from the take-out window (the only option around lunchtime on weekdays, I believe), I simply cannot keep spending $15 for stale chips and tiny, lukewarm tacos that are a shadow of their dinnertime selves. I have never been to any other restaurant with such a discrepancy in quality between lunch and dinner. Agua Verde pretty much has a captive audience among the UW Medical Center employees and faculty/staff in nearby research buildings, so it's like they can't be bothered to deliver a great product. What's sad is that I know they're capable of doing so just hours later! I wanted to give this restaurant 4 stars because the tacos truly can be delightful, but I have major reservations about recommending Agua Verde until they get their lunch system sorted out. If you do come here, make sure to try my salsa hack - mix the medium chipotle salsa with the spicy one for a deliciously sweet, spicy, tangy combo.","3","9/25/2019","128","Agua Verde Cafe","959 reviews","1303 NE Boat St","Mexican","http://yelp.com/biz/agua-verde-cafe-seattle","3"
"145","128","I wouldn't come back for the food alone, but it's good enough for post activity eating and drinking from it's neighbor, the Agua Verde Paddle Club. I really felt like I earned that margarita after one hour of paddle boarding. We had a group of 11, and the indoor cafe didn't take reservations, but I was directed to email their events person who was able to reserve a table for us outside at the Marina Cantina. They serve food and drink out there too, and we were blessed with a sunny day, so it was perfect. Prickly Pear Margarita $10.50: It's so pink! And refreshing too. Chicken Quesadilla $11.50: Tortilla had a nice crisp, which I like. The chicken itself was OK. I recall it being a tad on the dry side. Margarita Lima $10.50: I think I liked the prickly pear better, although that may be bias due to the color. I'm not confident that I could tell the 2 apart if subjected to a blind taste test.  *****My Star Ratings: 1 Star - Terrible. Just thinking about it makes me angry. 2 Stars - Meh. Unlikely for me to return. 3 Stars - OK. Open to coming back, but wouldn't go out of my way to. 4 Stars - Yummy! Will definitely return if I haven't already. 5 Stars - AMAZING!!! Would plan my day or even a trip around eating here.","3","9/22/2019","128","Agua Verde Cafe","959 reviews","1303 NE Boat St","Mexican","http://yelp.com/biz/agua-verde-cafe-seattle","3"
"146","128","A yummy and adorable place on the water! The food: we stopped in for breakfast and were very surprised with this awesome little place. We got the veggie breakfast burrito, the chorizo breakfast burrito, and the huarache. They were all great! The flavors were wonderful. The veggie breakfast burrito was AMAZING - so full of flavors that I have not had in a breakfast burrito before. It was egg, yams, beans, corn, peppers, and cheese. The yams added such a fun twist to the burrito! The chorizo was also very good but I still liked the veggie better because of how fresh and "clean" it tasted. The tortilla on the huarache was homemade and delicious. They make their own salsas and they are SO Good! We also got the raspberry mango scone and I was so impressed with how it tasted! For drinks we got 2 coffees and the pina drink. The atmosphere: AWESOME! The vibe of the restaurant is awesome for all meals. We got to sit facing the water and it was absolutely beautiful! Would I come back? Most definitely!","5","7/30/2019","128","Agua Verde Cafe","959 reviews","1303 NE Boat St","Mexican","http://yelp.com/biz/agua-verde-cafe-seattle","3"
"147","128","I couldn't be happier. It was a hot sunny Saturday and the mango slushy margarita was a hit !  A little refresher before the food arrived was super nice to get at the window before ordering !!  The ordering process was smooth and although it seemed that every table was packed our food came out in a timely fashion. My carnitas tacos were flavorful and really good. The guacamole was phenomenal. My wife had the pisole soup. The bite I had was also fantastic. The view from the deck was full of Seattle water way traffic and was never dull. A great place to come on a Saturday and have a few drinks and enjoy people watching.","5","5/12/2019","128","Agua Verde Cafe","959 reviews","1303 NE Boat St","Mexican","http://yelp.com/biz/agua-verde-cafe-seattle","3"

My friend and I shared the mangodilla and the carnitas tortas and we loved them both. I especially loved the mangodilla as the sweetness of the mango and the savory chicken just worked so well together. All of the salsas were great too!

You place your order at the counter before you grab a table. I ordered mushroom tacos and a house made strawberry lemonade, hubby got a vegetarian quesadillas. Both the entrees were very good and so were the salsas from the salsa bar.

"151","128","We dropped in here last night and they were busy, I will give them that. We were seated right away on the deck outside. That's a good start! Sadly, from there we received 0 service. We waited with menus on the table for 10 minutes, while we saw 3 employees come and check/close out other diners and bus tables. No greeting or acknowledgment of them coming to take our order anytime soon.Okayyyyyy so we headed to the bar, no big deal. Lucky us again, we swiped seats right away BUT again no service! Literally sat there for 5 minutes as the bartender helped others. Great, no problem but when you see us/are near us can you greet/acknowledge that we are there and might get our order taken at some point?Maybe they were busy and didn't need more customers. We can only be so patient so sadly 1 star for them.

I would've preferred some rice and beans like most Mexican restaurants do. Place is perfect on a sunny day though! There's plenty of outdoor seating which is great.

Its that kind of a place where you just chill and have good food and drinks. Their boozy drinks are really good too !The service was great with the waitress seating us where we wanted to her recommendations as well !.

"154","128","I used to come here a lot in the mornings because it's the closest thing to my work at the Med Center (other than the awful cafeteria), but then a couple of months ago, they changed ownership and their breakfast steak (carne asada) burrito. Now it tastes bland and awful even drenched with green sauce, which caused me great sadness because, frankly, it was the only decent thing other than margaritas (I don't drink much, so that's useless to me). Basically a couple of mornings full of lament and disappointment meant the end of my relationship with Agua Verde. I have honestly never had particularly good food here even before the management change, I used to kinda thought the salmon tacos were ok, but quite a few co-workers mentioned they changed that too, and they were pretty sad. So yeah, no more. However, I would still recommend it if only for the view. I love the views here, and I've rented paddle boats here. Yes, definitely go, may be only go once, but just understand the caveats.","2","5/24/2019","128","Agua Verde Cafe","959 reviews","1303 NE Boat St","Mexican","http://yelp.com/biz/agua-verde-cafe-seattle","3"

"157","128","It is hard to write about friends that have passed on. Writing about the death of the Agua Verde restaurant that once was amazing, and the thing that has taken its place, it will be incomplete and very likely inaccurate. This is my sole view after coming to Aqua Verde for over fourteen years. I speak of Mexican food with no mean understanding. I lived in San Diego for many years, spending countless weekends and weeks on the baja peninsula. I've driven to Cabo San Lucas three times. I've eaten in five-star rated restaurants in Tijuana. I get regional dish differences. We have cooked Mexican style for our kids, and they, as adults, cook Mexican dishes that are pretty darn great.6/30 my son and I went to Aqua Verde for dinner. We noticed the bar had replace about 1/3 of the seating and walls had been removed. This made the dining area incredibly loud. Music was playing very loud and people were trying to talk over it. Chairs were jammed very close to each other. You had to lean across the table halfway to make yourself heard in a conversation. On the menu we saw significant changes. I looked for the non-traditional smoked salmon tacos. They were gone. I opted for the carnitas tacos and my son opted for grilled rockfish. Our waiter had to be flagged down for the order as he rushed around ignoring us. The salsa bar is now a cart and the salsa's and chips seemed the same quality and standard. The guacamole was the first sign. It was severely spiked with serrano chile (or possibly small jalapeno) and was very hot. This isn't typical for Aqua Verde to head toward Tex-Mex level hot, but it wasn't Sonoran style. And we as a family like hot, flavorful.The rockfish tacos came and my son noticed they were filled with seeded chopped chiles as well. He had me taste the dry rubbed fish and I found the seasoning to be mildly tasteless. Some cumin white pepper, and paprika perhaps? He cooks as well The Carnitas pork was tasteless. I had asked for no beans or rice and was looking forward to the cranberry slaw that I know and love. The slaw that came was a redcabbage based slaw heavy on Mayo. It was pretty horrible too. The waiter came by and asked how my slaw was. I responded "it is horrible" and because of the sound levels or perhaps just not expecting it, he replied "Great!" and walked away.The rest of the meal proceeded with us eating quickly to get out of the place. The waiter never refilled our water glasses nor asked if wanted another round of drinks. The water would have been good due to the excessive seeded peppers on the tacos and in the Guac. We paid and left in mourning at the loss of atmosphere, service, and food quality.","2","7/2/2019","128","Agua Verde Cafe","959 reviews","1303 NE Boat St","Mexican","http://yelp.com/biz/agua-verde-cafe-seattle","3"

"160","128","Love this place - a Seattle classic at this point over where the U District meets Lake Union, just east of the University bridge. Further east is where the "Montlake cut" is, and further west is the north end of Lake Union.The food isn't a revelation - being a lot of Mexican/American classic dishes (tacos, burritos, quesadillas). But the salsa bar has good variety, the service is decent, and the view can't be beat. For what it is (family/group friendly Mexican place with reasonable prices) I don't think there are lot of other options that are better. I do think the decor is getting a little long in the tooth and they could use some upgrading of the HVAC system. Was a little hot on the summer day when we went here and sat in the patio (inside) area. But I get that there's not a lot of money in restaurants, so just be aware of that when you come.Parking can be hit or miss, but there's a few lots and the street parking around here isn't as tight as The Ave or other parts of the U District.","4","12/3/2018","128","Agua Verde Cafe","959 reviews","1303 NE Boat St","Mexican","http://yelp.com/biz/agua-verde-cafe-seattle","3"

"163","129","I finally got to come here after it being on my list for so long!!!it definitely did not disappoint for sure.I love the beach casual atmosphere as you walk into the restaurant. There's also a little fire pit which was also nice as it was a little cold. You also order at the counter and then a pager will turn off once your food is ready. We ordered the western Indies jerk chicken and the Bart sandwich and even though it says it is made to order, it took less than 10 minutes for our food is be done. Not only was it was fast the food was cooked perfectly. The jerk chicken dish came with rice, beans, mango slaw and a maduros. The chicken was tender, flavorful and juicy. The mango slaw was eh, no mango and kind of bland. The rice and beans were ok as well.  The Bart was huge for what you paid for and came with a lot of filling. It was super glad flavorful and I like that the bread was toasted. I definitely like the sandwich better than the plate but both were pretty good. Definitely would come back to try other things on their menu.","4","9/21/2019","129","Bongos","826 reviews","6501 Aurora Ave N","Cuban","http://yelp.com/biz/bongos-seattle","4"
"164","129","Me and my boyfriend have always heard great things about Bongos and were not disappointed at all from our trip here. We decided to grab lunch here and then walk around the lake on a sunny afternoon. It was very crowded at Bongos, I'm assuming because of the nice weather, being a Saturday, and the food is great. The outdoor patio is also dog-friendly, if you plan on bringing your pup, as we did. For food, I ordered the spicy shrimp plate. I would highly recommend this unless you can't handle spice at all. I thought the shrimp wasn't too spicy, but extremely flavorful. My boyfriend ordered their jerk chicken which was also very good. Each plate came with slaw, black beans, and white rice. We both got extremely full with each of our plates and ended up having leftovers. Overall, I would highly recommend Bongos if you're into Caribbean food.","5","9/3/2019","129","Bongos","826 reviews","6501 Aurora Ave N","Cuban","http://yelp.com/biz/bongos-seattle","4"

"167","129","It's hard not to love a good Caribbean sandwich. Especially ones so loaded that they fall apart as you're chowing down. I ordered the Desi Sandwich. It came with braised pork, caramelized onions, jalapeños, and house aioli sauce. The food came out within 5-10 minutes, so not having to wait long is always nice. My sandwich fell apart within the first few bites so I just used the fork and ate it like a salad. The bun started to get a little soggy but it was still delicious nonetheless. I think next time I'm going to try to ask for the sandwich buns on the side so that it can remain crispy throughout my meal. Other than the food. Atmosphere is a cute beachy vibe with lots of outdoor seating and actual sand. A very relaxing environment on a warm summer day.

"168","129","With 800+ reviews for Bongos on Yelp, there is a reason why the place still averages 4.5 stars: the food.The curry chicken and jerk chicken were standouts, and the yucca fries were excellent. All around us diners were oohing and aahing over plates of pork, shrimp, and chicken. Even the rice and beans and slaw were flavorful and tasty. Service was quick and friendly, especially for a busy Sunday morning when a line formed ten deep. We sat inside to avoid two ill-behaved dogs that were barking and whining while their adult-child owners sat completely self-absorbed, staring at their telephones, ignoring the mutts' need for discipline, oblivious to the annoyance of the patrons seated in their vicinity. The outside "deck" area is partially covered with sand that has been hauled in to provide the illusion of being near the ocean. If walking through sand is not to your liking, you can sit inside with the grown-ups and enjoy some of the most delicious Caribbean food anywhere.

"171","129","One of my favorite places to eat in Seattle. I love coming here for the outdoor sandy patio. What more can you ask for: Seattle sun, sandy beach, cute dogs everywhere and amazing carbbiean food? It's a pretty unique place. So first you head straight to the back where you order at the counter. Once you get your number they will bring the food to you. The yuca fries are a must. Comes out piping hot and is super crunchy. One order is never enough, especially if you're trying to share. Im not a big sandwich person so I stick to the rice and beans plates. You can't go wrong with anything on that menu, they all have so much flavor. None of the plates are too spicy either, just a nice little kick so I like adding the extra hot sauces provided at the table. Good quality portioned sized food for a decent price as well. 10/10!!

Making an otherwsie blight in a city into an amazing location - this place likely was an old gas station.I got a sandwich by accident but I would go for the plates with rice from what I saw,.. everything we tried.. amazing.My only gripes (I'd give 4.5 if possible), disposable plates and minimal bike parking.  Go here and DON'T tell your friends.","5","8/31/2019","129","Bongos","826 reviews","6501 Aurora Ave N","Cuban","http://yelp.com/biz/bongos-seattle","4"

The Caribbean dishes are delicious with so much flavor, and so much food! The first time I came I got the West Indies Chicken plate and although it was absolutely amazing, it was way too spicy for me, so the second time I got the Bucco Chicken plate and that hit the spot. The combination of rice, beans, slaw, and meat is to die for because the flavors on all of these just blend so well together.I personally haven't tried the burgers, but from what my friends told me, it was incredibly filling and so well prepared. I will definitely be coming here again, and I truly recommend everyone else to as well!

"175","129","Looks can really be deceiving for this place! My boyfriend and I both got "The Bart" on the menu. And we should've listened to all the other reviews saying how the sandwich was so messy and everyone regretted it. The sandwich itself was a train wreck it was so messy! Dripping all over your hands. The meat inside was so tender and good but then it soaked the bread making the bread soggy. I'm more of a fan of the Un Bien/Paeso sandwiches where you can still have the crunch of the bread. All in all it was good. And. So. Much. Meat!!!! Just a little too messy and soggyI did love the option of "The Bart" because it combines two sandwiches with all the great toppings. I want to come back and try one of their plates and sit on on their huge patio!

"179","129","After an intense 5 hours of outlet shopping, we were ready for a late night dinner. I'd done a quick search for food earlier and Bongos was the chosen spot. They specialize in Cuban and Caribbean cuisine.We dropped in on a Saturday evening (around 9:30pm). We were there late but they greeted us with smiles and open arms. The girl working the front was incredibly friendly and sweet. The decor is rustic and fun; love the surfboard up on the wall, the coffee bean bags decorating the ceiling, the hipster hanging lights and the sand out on the patio. A little hidden beach oasis.The menu is split into sandwiches, plates, combos and sides. They were sold out of multiple things (pork was all gone) so we asked for their recommendations. There's also 7 beer options available on draft. Love the beer tap that's dressed up as a bowling pin.- Ten pin pineapple wheat ale ($5.25 US pint) - we decided to try out their pineapple wheat ale which was refreshing and good pineapple tones.- Trinidad steak ($13.99 US) - marinated and grilled steak. We opted for medium rare which is exactly how it was cooked; tasty and tender. All their plates come with beans, rice, mango slaw and a maduro (plantain). Portions are generous and come with a good amount of meat. We were surprised to that there was a whole layer of rice underneath everything!- West Indies ($10.99 US) - jerk spiced chicken with west Indies sauce. The chicken had some heat to it but still retained all the flavour. Good bite and tons of chicken. The plantain was legit and we both liked the mango slaw.Excellent spot to grab Cuban/Caribbean food! Would definitely come back to Bongos and try their sandwiches next visit.","4","2/19/2019","129","Bongos","826 reviews","6501 Aurora Ave N","Cuban","http://yelp.com/biz/bongos-seattle","4"
"180","129","I have been wanting to give this place a visit since I bookmarked them like couple months ago. I finally got the chance and it didn't disappoint me at all. Especially their outdoor patio or an indoor beach?! I love it! Well creative idea to whoever came up with it. Got there on a Friday night, WOOOHOOOO! The line was pack... must be a good sign or people comes here just for the hype. Good thing it is not. Took me almost 40 mins to have an open table, but it was worth it. Everyone recommended the "Jerk Chicken" I just have to try it to believe that its the best. I also ordered the veggie platter as well. It was good, you get to try all their appetizers all in one plate. The Jerk Chicken was really good but it was a little too spicy for me the sauce on the top. Next time, I will order the same but with the sauce on the side. Overall, great experience for me. I can't wait to come to this place when its summer time. When you can sit outside.","4","1/30/2019","129","Bongos","826 reviews","6501 Aurora Ave N","Cuban","http://yelp.com/biz/bongos-seattle","4"
"181","130","This place is my favorite restaurant ever. I didn't fully appreciate how authentic their Indonesian food was until I went to Jakarta and  came back.

My personal favorites include hainan chicken rice & mie tak tak.

"183","130","Went in there around noon and was seated straight away. Wasn't very Crowded but the crowd started to build up around lunch time. We ordered beef rendang, hainan chicken rice and fried chicken. Beef rendang - 3/5Rendang should be packed with flavor and aroma of spices. But this rendang is very tough to chew and didn't get much aroma from spices. The flavor is also very lacking. Won't be ordering it again. hainan chicken - 4/5Hainan chicken was okay. The meat was tinder and the rice was nice. I loveee the sauces very much. It comes with three different sauces and mint one is my fav! But if you r just going in for the hainan chicken, I would recommend WangYan which is close by and has better Hainan chicken. Fried chicken - 3/5Juicy inside and crispy outside but not much flavor for my liking.","3","7/9/2019","130","Beetle Cafe","112 reviews","4334 University Way NE","Asian Fusion","http://yelp.com/biz/beetle-cafe-seattle-4","4"
"184","130","Came here on a Saturday afternoon for some boba. I have heard good things about their boba, so I wanted to give it a try. I got a jasmine milk tea with boba. The amount of boba could be a bit more generous, but the milk tea is pretty decent. It's not too sweet, which I'm a huge fan of. The server will ask about the sugar level, and I got medium. Great service. As I was almost done with my boba, I had a piece of mysterious leafy green stuff in my tea. I assumed it was the tea leaf because otherwise it would drive me nuts. I would certainly come back for the boba.","4","2/24/2019","130","Beetle Cafe","112 reviews","4334 University Way NE","Asian Fusion","http://yelp.com/biz/beetle-cafe-seattle-4","4"

"186","130","Been wanting to try this place out and have to say it was underwhelming. Maybe it was hyped up in my head too much but it was just average. The service and presentation was nice but the value and food was sub par especially with many other dining options around the area. We had the chicken soto, beef rendang with crispy pork combo, and the chicken hainan. Also the popcorn chicken and perkedel (smashes potato w/ground beef) as appetizers. The appetizers were the best things as the soto was a bit too bland and needed some salt; the crispy pork was CRISPY, as in over cooked hard; beef rendang was tender though so saved the combo somewhat. The hainan chicken while alright was just that - alright. Hot Sauce was good tho. Gotta give them that.","3","1/22/2019","130","Beetle Cafe","112 reviews","4334 University Way NE","Asian Fusion","http://yelp.com/biz/beetle-cafe-seattle-4","4"

"188","130","DO NOT GO HERE!!!! My friends and i decided to come here for lunch and to say we were disappointed is an UNDERSTATEMENT! First off, it took twenty minutes for our food to arrive which is much too long, especially for a casual restaurant like this. When the food came it looked COMPLETELY different from the menu. I ordered a pork dish over rice and when it came it was mostly rice with a ground beef looking meat on top. In addition, it was overly salted and super sweet. I also ordered the milk tea and it was awful, tasting mostly like milk. I would not recommend this restaurant to anyone PERIODTTT","1","9/3/2019","130","Beetle Cafe","112 reviews","4334 University Way NE","Asian Fusion","http://yelp.com/biz/beetle-cafe-seattle-4","4"

"191","130","We came here on a Saturday for lunch, there were about three other parties in the restaurant. The food is fairly authentic, my wife who is Indonesian attested to that. However, the portions are tiny, service is slow, and the dishes come with very few vegetables (when they should have a bit more according to my wife). As evidence of the small portions, my 18-month-old ate an entire dish by himself.  Despite there being very few other people there, our food took about 20 minutes to arrive. When we went, there were only two people working in the restaurant, one in the kitchen and one in the front.","3","9/2/2018","130","Beetle Cafe","112 reviews","4334 University Way NE","Asian Fusion","http://yelp.com/biz/beetle-cafe-seattle-4","4"

"193","130","Yey Indonesian food!!!! I've had a pleasure of trying Indonesian when my friends opened their restaurant on aurora a while back. Legit authentic Indonesian food from Jakarta! It was a dream! And the only time I've had it!! Walked in here not realizing they have it too! Came for the shave ice but stayed for dinner too!! Yummm!! They are super friendly! The menu is a book and a lot of options for first timer. I wasn't particularly hungry for a meal! So I went with their $5.50 pork bowl and $4.50 popcorn chicken for pre shave ice snack! Lo behold! So much food!! I forgot that I was on the AVe! Though I don't remember this many options when I was UW student! But then again I hardly leave the campus!! So yea!!! Huge portions!!! Huge!!! You won't find this on the next block! That's for sure!! Pork bowl was delish! Came with boiled egg! Their homemade hot sauce is EPIC! Didn't quite care of the soy sauce taste in my bowl but love how their amazing homemade pepper water changed the flavor!!! So hot! So good! Pop corn chicken was good too. Again! Two of us couldn't finish it!Shave ice was choose your flavor, ice cream and 2 toppings for $5.50. I went with mochi, azuki, matcha ice cream and strawberry flavor ice! Huge bowls! Mochi doesn't feel homemade though but tasty regardless! All of this came out to $17!!! Talk about living large on student budget! I know where to go next time I want Indonesian food! They have other items that are normal priced too aka $10-$12. But can't beat the deal items either!","3","9/29/2017","130","Beetle Cafe","112 reviews","4334 University Way NE","Asian Fusion","http://yelp.com/biz/beetle-cafe-seattle-4","4"

"195","130","Where the heck was this place when I went to UW?! Really cute Indonesian cafe on the Ave with great food and GREAT prices for budget-savvy college students, especially during lunch. They have some lunch combos from $8-$11 that come with a decent amount of food, plus the $8 lunch combos come with a free drink. Not only do they have Hainan Chicken, but they have SHAVED SNOW... a delicious dessert that's finally starting to come to the PNW.The space has very cute decor - they even have a "love lock" wall! I also think it's cool that they sell some Indonesian snacks and candy - saves you a trip to the Asian supermarket. It's very self service here, as you order at the counter then seat yourself. Plus you bus your own tables. My family ordered the following:- Batagor $5.50: This is a fried fish dumpling with tofu that comes with a peanut sauce. Super tasty, though it reminds me more of a fried fish ball. Would never think about mixing peanuts with seafood, but it's actually pretty good. It'd be a tasty afternoon snack.- Hainan Chicken Lunch Combo ($8): YAAAAS... some place on the Ave serves Hainan chicken! True to the dish, it comes with the chicken rice, chicken soup, and sliced chicken. It also comes with the sauces - my personal favorite is the ginger garlic sauce, but I love adding the hot sauce for an extra kick. I don't know what the brown sauces were, but they were good too. As part of the lunch combo, it also seems to come with the tea egg and a spring roll - these were just OK, but filling. The egg was... tasteless and the spring roll had little substance. This combo set also comes with a free drink - I got an iced green tea that was tasty.Surprisingly the chicken is actually boneless... so while it may not look as big as the traditional Hainan chicken, it's probably the same amount of meat you get in regular Hainan chicken when you factor the bones, haha. My favorite part was the soup - you could really taste the chicken. While the chicken and soup are decent, I was kind of disappointed in the chicken rice, which is usually my favorite part. It was so flat in flavor, compared to other Hainan chicken sets I've had. There wasn't that delicious oily chicken flavor - mainly seemed like garlic fried rice. Mixing the rice with some of the soup seemed to help mitigate it.- Two Item Combo w/ Hainan Chicken and Crispy Pork ($11): This is actually a REALLY good deal if you're hungry - it's a lot of food. They give you a choice of the spring roll or a scoop of ice cream, but it doesn't come with the same free drink as the other combos. Hainan chicken still came with the rice and soup, but the crispy pork was actually really good. Kind of reminded me of Filipino lechon, as the pork was very tender and savory.- Shaved Mango Snow w/ Mango Sorbet, Lychee Boba, and Jack Fruit ($4.50): Daaaaamn. When I was at UW, our dessert options were mainly ice cream, boba, and froyo. This generation is lucky they get shaved snow! This isn't regular shaved ice with a fruity syrup poured on top... it's a fruit puree that gets "shaved" with such a fluffy texture for melt in your mouth goodness. DO NOT MIX THIS UP WITH THAT HAWAIIAN DESSERT. This mango shaved snow was WAAAAY fruitier than that rainbow colored ice.Rant aside, the shaved snow is pretty legit - I've had better in SoCal and the Bay Area, but this is Asian dessert progress! It's also a large portion! My family of four was able to share it. Lychee boba give it a nice sweet flavor and the condensed milk adds a touch of creaminess. I think it's nice they include 2 cookie sticks for visual impact. Seriously though, if you haven't had shaved snow... this is a good place to start.Again, highly recommend this place for lunch on the Ave, especially since the location isn't too far up the Ave that it's easy to access from campus.","4","4/25/2017","130","Beetle Cafe","112 reviews","4334 University Way NE","Asian Fusion","http://yelp.com/biz/beetle-cafe-seattle-4","4"

The staff member was so nice and seemed so happy to do her job even though it was late in the day towards closing.I had the Hainan Chicken rice dish (just like Singapore chicken rice). Rice topped with steam chicken, side of cucumbers, sweet soy sauce, and ginger sauce. For ~9$, you get a good amount of tasty food!Overall: The service was great! The food was reasonably priced and delicious. And being one of the few places that serve an authentic Hainan chicken rice, I definitely would recommend to others and will return myself.","5","9/18/2017","130","Beetle Cafe","112 reviews","4334 University Way NE","Asian Fusion","http://yelp.com/biz/beetle-cafe-seattle-4","4"

"200","130","For those who may have frequented the Yogurtland on the Ave in UDistrict, that place is now replaced by this cute little cafe.Why cute? It's because once you set foot inside, you'll be greeted by a friendly staff, interesting and colorful decor of random knickknacks and a picturesque menu. With a strong emphasis on Indonesian food for most of the items, everything is decently priced. Portions aren't hugeeee but the quality of food is pretty good. Came here with a friend and we left the place full and content.For food, we both opted for the same item which was the Bakso Malang, which comprised of: vermicelli + beef balls + fried tofu + fried wontons in beef broth. Overall, taste was yummmmy. The noodles were soft and chewy and I really like the simplicity of the meal. Even though it might kind of look like pho, I assure the taste isn't anything alike. For dessert, we chose to get the snow ice and for $6.50, it was quite the bowlful of sweetness! We barely could finish the amount and overall, it was a solid ending to a nice dinner. Do be aware that certain flavors are seasonal! So make sure to ask the staff on what's available before you get excited about your order. I would definitely swing by here again and try out more sweets and food dishes :)","4","12/12/2016","130","Beetle Cafe","112 reviews","4334 University Way NE","Asian Fusion","http://yelp.com/biz/beetle-cafe-seattle-4","4"
"201","131","Walking randomly around looking for something to eat. There is an overload of Asian food choices in the area, but was more in the burger mood when we spotted this place. Cool local vibe. We ordered a cheeseburger and a Hawaiian Burger. Both were served up quickly and were incredibly hot and fresh off the grill. Share a combo and just order a second burger, because the French fries serving is enough for 3 people. For Two people, it was about $30. Any complainers about price need to understand the high Seattle minimum wage, high rents, and high sales taxes. Based on comparable food in the city, the prices are completely fair.

"202","131","AMBIANCEIt's pretty standard in here. Nothing too crazy, just a normal Ave restaurant catered towards college kids.FOODI went with the UW burger this time around. The patty itself was pretty standard, but the veggie toppings were really fresh. Probably could have gone without the onion rings in the burger, but I didn't mind them. The house sauce is what makes this place shine. It's like a barbecue sauce without the tang. I do appreciate the toasted bun on both sides. The burger does get a little messy towards the end, but that's inevitable, especially with fresh veggies. The side of fries is huge. It's enough for two people to share.OVERALLJust Burger is pretty solid. If you're craving a burger, and are in the area, it's not a bad play.

"203","131","My friend wanted to grab burgers for dinner on The Ave. Just Burgers had the highest Yelp rating and so we decided to give it a try.The restaurant as a whole is fairly small. The ordering counter and the grill are crowded into the left side of the restaurant while seating take up the rest of the limited floor space.Just Burgers had a wide selection of burgers ranging from about $9-$15 in price. Fries are not included so you have to order them on the side for about an additional $4. However, they also have a large variety of fries too including regular, waffle and sweet potato. They also serve shakes, but we weren't in a milkshake mood at the time.zMy friend ordered the spicy jalapeño burger and fries and I ordered the mushroom burger. Service was prompt.The burgers here are really BIG; I was hungry but was only able to finish half of my mushroom burger. I enjoyed the grilled mushrooms and onions on my burger, but the beef patty was rather fatty and greasy. It was the least delectable l part of the burger. My friend said his burger was very spicy and downed several cups of water. The amount of fries they gave us could easily feed at least three people, but they weren't super crispy or golden; they weren't the worst fries I've had but they were definitely not the best fries I've had either.I'm not a burger connoisseur, but like the name says, it's Just Burgers. The food is nothing special, but enough to satisfy the occasional burger craving.Overall, 3/5 stars for food, 3/5 stars for atmosphere, and 4/5 stars for service.","3","10/7/2019","131","Just Burgers","313 reviews","4510 University Way NE","Burgers","http://yelp.com/biz/just-burgers-seattle-4","4"
"204","131","What's in a name? Well, I'll tell you: Just Burgers delivers just burgers!I came here for a big double cheese burger cooked flat top style and that's exactly what I got! Two juicy patties on a nice egg bun that held everything together. The patties had a nice crisp char typical of cooking on a flat top (which I love!).  Curly fries were nice and hot and came in a big sleeve (probably enough for two normal Seattle portions of fries): Good, crisp, greasy and salty!Don't expect to get your mind-blown, but you will leave full and happy if you come to Just Burgers. Some downsides: a bit pricey (~$15 for double cheese burger and curly fries) and the inside is a bit grungy, but what did you expect for a student restaurant after all???

"205","131","I made the mistake of coming here without checking the prices first. I like my burgers with just mustard, ketchup, and pickles, and $8 for this type of burger with those toppings is insane. And that doesn't even include the price of the fries. For some reason, they put ketchup under and on top of the hamburger patty. The bread didn't hold up at all; it just turned into mush. The patty itself had no flavor whatsoever, and neither did the fries. Even the fact that they were grossly over-salted didn't help them. And on top of that, half of them were limp and squishy.The decor is pretty utilitarian and uninspired.I regretted coming here, and I definitely won't be back.","1","2/4/2019","131","Just Burgers","313 reviews","4510 University Way NE","Burgers","http://yelp.com/biz/just-burgers-seattle-4","4"

Just got a burger for takeout and found a piece of plastic in it. It appears to be the clip from a bag of bread or buns. I still could have been okay with this - accidents do happen and nobody got hurt - but on top of that, the burger (~10$) was bland and poorly assembled.

Though the a bit pricey, the portion size and food quality definitely makes it worth. One of the reasons why this place is my favorite is its versatility. You can opt the beef patty for grilled chicken, crispy chicken (my fav), salmon, and more! Depending on your mood, you can get something light like the grilled chicken or the juicy beef patty if you're trying to feel the food coma afterwards! These options make just burgers so special to me.All in all, definitely check this place out and make sure to try the California Burger w/ fries!","5","5/9/2019","131","Just Burgers","313 reviews","4510 University Way NE","Burgers","http://yelp.com/biz/just-burgers-seattle-4","4"

"214","131","We've been here a few times before the remodel, and this was our second time coming back after the redesign. One nice thing here is you get free refills on soda and there is plenty of seating. Plus the staff are really friendly and the food comes out at light speed. This time we had the California burger combo w waffle fries and soda plus an extra side of mozzarella sticks. The mozzarella sticks were not crispy with band marinara. The waffle fries were perfectly fine. For the burger it's is not as crispy and thin as a smashed burger or as big and juicy a traditional burger patty. It's a little close textured, kind of mushy and pasty. Overall, the meal was not worth the price. Additionally everything feels a bit sticky the wood furniture just not ideal for cleaning. We really tried to like this place with all the options it has; however it has not yet impressed us.","2","7/10/2018","131","Just Burgers","313 reviews","4510 University Way NE","Burgers","http://yelp.com/biz/just-burgers-seattle-4","4"

"217","131","I was craving In-N-Out and found Just Burgers on Yelp...It's not the same, but was enough to somewhat satisfy that burger craving.Damn Seattle, why are burgers so expensive? I got a Texas burger (has jalapeños) with no sides and it was about $10 after tax and tip. I felt a little cheated but was pleasantly surprised at how large the actual burger was when it arrived.Decent buns, juicy patty, everything else was standard...but I was so confused at just how many jalapeños they put in. I love spicy food, but there were legit over 20 thin slices and it overpowered every other flavor.Besides that it was acceptable and I was satisfied but not stuffed. The menu is also very wordy and can be a little confusing at first. I would definitely try a different burger next time I'm in the area.","4","5/14/2018","131","Just Burgers","313 reviews","4510 University Way NE","Burgers","http://yelp.com/biz/just-burgers-seattle-4","4"
"218","131","I'm normally not a fan of burger joints because I never feel like I'm paying for something that I can't somewhat make myself. This place was surprisingly good.I tried to order healthy by getting a chicken California burger thinking that I would be sacrificing taste for health, but boy was I wrong. This wasn't your typical frozen Tyson chicken patty that your local corner deli will serve up. I'm talking strips of real grilled chicken layered between two generously sized buttery buns, cushioend with creamy avocado and juicy tomato. The burger managed to be immensely hearty and filling without leaving me feeling like I had gobbled down a concentrated portion of type two diabetes and hypertension-inducing meat. I appreciate that the bun also maintained it's integrity as I chomped through the burger, refusing to get mushy. The fries were excellent as well, coming in a HUGE portion as well as being perfectly salted. They tasted like fries from McDonald's... Which if you ask me, is a good thing.There's a lot on the menu here, and I can't wait to come back and try some other specialities, such as the UW burger.","4","6/10/2018","131","Just Burgers","313 reviews","4510 University Way NE","Burgers","http://yelp.com/biz/just-burgers-seattle-4","4"

I paid extra and ordered a specialty burger but they only gave me a basic cheeseburger. I asked for the burger's sauces on the side and did not receive them. It's very over priced.

"221","132","I've been here many times, mostly the morning after a night out. The pho here is standard, nothing amazing but also nothing bad.This time I changed it up and ordered the Hainan chicken and it was amazing. It's a bit of a toss up which part of the chicken you'll get, I got the thigh which meant there was a lot of bones. But regardless it tasted pretty good. However the standout part of the dish was the rice, which was cooked in chicken broth! It was addicting and really good.The atmosphere leans towards a club vibe, with neon lights everywhere. The servers are ok, pretty accommodating given we had 9 people there. Normally I'd give this place a 3, since it's pretty average, but it's also pretty cheap for seattle food! If you're feeling adventurous, I'd recommend coming here. It isnt the best pho I've had, but the price definitely makes up for it.However, I'd be careful when you order a small pho with everything in it. They charge the same price as a large pho without telling you!","4","11/7/2019","132","Pho Shizzle","199 reviews","4235 University Way NE","Vietnamese","http://yelp.com/biz/pho-shizzle-seattle-2","4"

"224","132","Out of the 4 pho restaurants I counted on University Way, I went with this one, based on the Yelp reviews. I made an in person take-out order for a small size steak pho, a small size steak/brisket pho, and spring rolls. Ambiance: Although I did not eat at the restaurant, I sat there waiting for my order enough to see that it was a relatively clean and nice looking restaurant. Not run-down or dingy like some of my favorite pho spots. There were a few flies or gnats in the air likely due to the door being open but they didn't bother me.Service: There were two staff manning the front counter. The male appeared irritated while taking my order and while servicing customers. No smile. No small talk. Just clearly did not want to be there. The female was friendly and smiled, and even double checked to see that I had been served. My take-out order was completed promptly.Food: Blah. Not bad just nothing special. Standard pho broth and definitely not in the category of being one of my favorites. Although I will give them credit for the meat which was more tender than I expected, and for loading up the noodles.  Overall, glad I tried it but probably wouldn't return until I've tried the other pho restaurants and don't find a better place.","3","8/6/2019","132","Pho Shizzle","199 reviews","4235 University Way NE","Vietnamese","http://yelp.com/biz/pho-shizzle-seattle-2","4"

I had the seafood pho and it was great! The broth had such a good flavor and it was packed full of seafood. Others in my group got the beef pho and the chicken rice and vermicelli plate. The flavors of all the food were phenomenal. I hadn't had such good food in quite some time! Oh - the large bowl of pho is HUGE!! The atmosphere - a white pho spot on University ave!

"226","132","I will preface this post by saying that I have a cold - so my tastebuds (may) be off a bit. I came here for lunch today - I needed some pho to feel better. I ordered the brisket and meatball pho, egg rolls, and my bf ordered the banh mi thit nuong. The egg rolls were super stale - I cannot express how stale it was! I was actually shock - it was drenched in oil and tasted like straight up cardboard. I wonder how long the egg rolls have been sitting in the heat lamp or have been reheated due to the unpleasant texture?2nd - the pho was incredibly salty. I'm pretty sure I exceed my sodium intake for the day because of this meal. I only added a small drop of the hoisin sauce and immediately regretted it.. which sucks because I wanted to drink the beef broth to feel better. The one star goes to the banh mi - it was plentiful, flavorful, and delicious. The pork was soft and not too fatty.Could this have been an off day?","2","9/6/2019","132","Pho Shizzle","199 reviews","4235 University Way NE","Vietnamese","http://yelp.com/biz/pho-shizzle-seattle-2","4"
"227","132","It was aight -- got a broken rice plate with barbecued pork, egg cake, some sort of cross between pork floss and meat, and grilled barbecue pork. The egg cake was quite tasty and moist, but the grilled barbecue pork was mostly bone -- barely any meat. I wasn't a huge fan of the pork floss / meat thing, but I think this is more personal taste. The plate had a huge amount of rice.Had the bun bo hue on another occasion and it seemed rather sweet. Lots of meat inside -- but not the traditional cuts you'd expect in a bun no hue -- definitely more cheaper meatball. Extremely extremely filling though -- great student fare to keep you full.Waiters and cashiers are a bit surly. I guess this is on account of being tip optional. One plus is that they try to get you in and out as soon as possible, so no long wait if you're starving. You get what you pay for in this case. $11 plus tax for a budget meal.Overall, wouldn't go out of my way to go here, but if you're on the Ave and want some alright Vietnamese food, pho sho it will fit the bill.","3","5/24/2019","132","Pho Shizzle","199 reviews","4235 University Way NE","Vietnamese","http://yelp.com/biz/pho-shizzle-seattle-2","4"

We were heading to the korean tofu shop down the road but stopped because pho was calling our name.We were immediately seated and the food came out very quick. I got the large tendon pho while the roommate got the large brisket pho with double tendon (extra $2). He complained that there wasn't really any extra tendon in his. Regardless, the pho broth was way too salty, I couldn't drink the broth so I only ate the noodles and tendon...which was a sad day. Pho is all about the broth.THE FINAL BAMBOO: Overall the damage done was $9 for a large pho.

"231","132","I discovered Pho Shizzle last summer actually, when I came here with my friends from school. We were craving pho and saw that Pho Shizzle had some good reviews. It was conveniently located on the Ave, although parking is kind of difficult (street parking only!). There is also a good amount of seats in the restaurant. I've been here probably around 10 times now, during lunch and dinner, and never really had to wait to be seated.The pho here is really cheap and good. I normally get a small brisket pho, since the large bowls are actually HUGE and I can't finish one of those.  For only $6.50, that is usually enough to fill me up. However, if you want to split this into multiple meals, the large is only a dollar extra ($7.50) and that can easily cover two meals. The service here is pretty fast, and the pho comes steaming hot in a plastic bowl. The broth is savory and rich, and there is a decent amount of  meat in the bowl. It basically tasted like exactly what you would expect. The brisket is also quite tender and there are not a lot of tendons. The noodles themselves were pretty average-- it just tasted like what rice noodles were supposed to taste like.Although this place is just a simple casual restaurant and there's not much to write home about, it's a very solid option for pho in the Seattle area, and probably the best value on the west side. Recommend coming here for a casual lunch or dinner with friends, especially when it's cold outside.","4","12/8/2018","132","Pho Shizzle","199 reviews","4235 University Way NE","Vietnamese","http://yelp.com/biz/pho-shizzle-seattle-2","4"

"234","132","This is actually going to be my favorite Pho place to go in the future. I been here couple of times already and just didn't have the chance to write them a review. I went here when they first open up. It was great, in the beginning they gave you free egg roll with purchase of Pho, but now they don't come with it anymore. It's alright! More importantly is that there Pho is really good. I usually order Large Pho every Pho restaurant I go to. Pho Shizzle, there large bowl is very big for a cheap price. Sometime I can't even finish it. I feel like there quantity of stuff in the bowl is more then other Pho restaurant which is a plus. There customer service is alright, I only care about the food. I do like there rice dishes too. My favorite is the one with grill pork chop with sherred pork, steam egg meatloaf, and veggies with rice. I have been eating that dish since I was a kid. Some places called that dish "Viet three treasure rice". I love it. After writing this review, I actually want a bowl of pho or there rice dish again.

The broth is deep and flavorful. There are so many pho places out there but this place definitely outweighs most of them. What I look for in a pho is their soup& noodle ratio. Most of the pho places tend to give too much noodles compare to the soup. However, this place has the right ratio so I can enjoy the soup until the end. Not to mention, their soup is such a good hangover cure!! [Price&Service] The price is fair and very affordable. It seems like the employees here are tired most of the time.

I ordered the mixed drink with pisco and it was GREAT!! Really refreshing and had the taste of many different berries.Once you are seated inside, if you're lucky enough to sit at the bar, you can watch everyone's dinner being made. It was really interesting to see all the chefs hard at work, making drinks, steaks on the grill, salads with fresh cheese and herbs. And all of the staff behind the bar was very friendly and  interactive with us. For dinner I ordered the grilled beef with chimichurri and creamed yuca which was a 10/10. The steak with homemade chimichurri was SO tender and packed with flavor. The creamed yuca was exquisite, I only wish I had more of it!!The only reason I took 1 star off was because 1) you can't make reservations, so be prepared to wait (limited seating inside) and 2) the hostess was NOT friendly towards us. She was thoroughly annoyed we asked if the bar was first-come first-serve (my first time here), and if we were able to order drinks at the outside bar.

Everyone seems to love it so I'm just out of the loop on this one, or so it would seem. The dishes often seem quite imbalanced. Like a smoked salmon with a smokey salsa. For my (what seems like very flawed) tastes, there's never enough salt or too much acid, or not enough. This place is always packed, the staff is friendly. I'm honestly probably delusional.

"246","133","Saw all the good reviews and I got excited about coming here since my friend picked the place. Between the two of us, we decided to get 4 dishes since we were aware that the portion size is on the smaller end. FOOD:Rockfish Ceviche - heard really good things about this dish so of course we had to try it! They weren't wrong when they say that the fish is fresh. It really is and I liked the lime taste to it. It adds a refreshing kick. Smoked Salmon - Another yummy dish that we got that didn't disappoint. I've never had a slab of smoked salmon before (usually would get them in slices for a bagel or crack) so this was delightful since I love smoked salmon. The cream was a nice compliment to the salmon. Spring Greens - The buttermilk sauce for this was surprising refreshing, probably due to the mint. Not a fan of radishes but overall, it was a good vegetable side to have!Black Rice - Really liked this dish a lot! It's unique and was our heavy dish for the meal. It complimented the rockfish ceviche really nicely. Rice is sticky and had a bit of cream consistency to it. Soft pieces of squid and I wish I could have more of it!ENVIRONMENT:We sat outside in the patio because it was a warm day and I really liked the decor of the place. It has a modern rustic kind of look to it. Came here for happy hour which was a good choice on our part since it meant saving a bit! The prices on the menu aren't the same as the menu online (probably not updated) so just be aware of that. Portion sizes are small, so don't come in expecting a lot.

Next out was the smoked salmon, which was absolutely incredible - the fish was flavorful, warm (which was a bit of a surprise) and an amazing texture. The mussels were next and probably my favorite dish of the night- they came out smothered in an absolutely delicious sauce (full of flavor and seasoning but not very spicy) and on a piece of Seawolf sourdough toast-- delicious! Finally, we had the (skirt?) steak- also delicious, also cooked perfectly.

Not mussels in broth, but mussels in a hearty aji amarillo served on thick-cut Sea Wolf sourdough. Good to share a bite for 2, just not what you might expect!Marinated kale salad with roasted sunchoke, dill pickle and cotija - well-dressed without being heavy, great textures. Pairs well with the Mussels toastIberico pork ribs - might be for limited run, but absolutely must get! Juicy, bursting with flavor, falling off the bone. Served on corona beans and braised greensLast but never least, dessert was a show-stopper! Sea Wolf Pain au Lait - bread pudding with apple, arbol, malt. The best ending.Loved our mezcal and bourbon cocktails, reasonably priced at $11:- Captain Hook: mezcal, rum, rhum shrubb, pineapple cilantro shrub, lemon - refreshing and tart, summer with soul. Nicely balanced on smokey mezcal- Hans Gruber: bourbon, china-china, spiced orange, lemon.

So fresh and well shucked.Mixed greens: these were fine, but not great. Lacked a little salt or flavor but are still refreshing. Rockfish ceviche: I liked it, but my partner wasn't a fan. It's light and refreshing and incredibly fresh, but won't blow your socks off. Albacore: our favorite dish! A punch of flavor and texture, I would go back for this. Salmon: another yummy choice, a safe bet if you like smoked salmon. The cream balances well with it and the sweet Smokey salty sauce it comes with.","4","7/28/2019","133","Manolin","462 reviews","3621 Stone Way N","Seafood","http://yelp.com/biz/manolin-seattle","4"
"250","133","The food was fantastic! We were blown away by how fresh each dish was. We were so intrigued with our food that we forgot to take photos! We ordered the rockfish ceviche, smoked salmon, mussels (with sea wolf bread...) and the slaw from the 'garden' option. The menu was different than what was posted on their website, but honestly anything you order is going be amazing!","5","11/14/2019","133","Manolin","462 reviews","3621 Stone Way N","Seafood","http://yelp.com/biz/manolin-seattle","4"
"251","133","Came here on a Sunday night as a group of 4 (no reservations) - we had to wait for about 15 minutes before we could get seated. They took us to the back to sit around an open fireplace! That area looked super cute and would be amazing to come back to experience it in the summer time. We started off the night with wine and oysters! Flavor was AMAZING - so fresh! I would recommend getting these :) Following that, our server guided us through the menu, saying that the fish and plates are on the smaller side while things from the grill were a little bigger. Everything is shared - so when it comes family style. For 4 of us, he recommended us getting 5-6 plates total. We decided on 4 plates since we wanted to get lots of ice cream afterwards (ya feel me? it was just one of those days that needed a lot of ice cream...)The menu is hard to comprehend (at least it was for me) since I didn't know what half of the ingredients were and it was hard to visualize/think about what it would taste like.We got their -Rockfish Ceviche (definitely get this) - SO fresh and well done, textures of the different components blended so well together and the flavor was phenomenal.-Mussels (definitely get this too) - its on top of sourdough that was from the bakery next door so its fresh bread and on top of it is this warm tasty sauce/gravy with mussels. also so good in flavor and memorable for sure!-Yellowfin - this one just kind of tasted like a spicy salsa-Kohlrabi salad - this was very delicious as well! you get the crunch from the pears and pistacios and the vinaigrette(?) cuts through really well too. I wish the portion for this was bigger! I felt like it was a little pricey for how much we got. But still good and would recommend haha.^four dishes will definitely not fill four people so I would recommend getting more! They do their seafood really well and they have a really cute ambiance that is also dim. They are more casual which makes it a good place to meet up with friends and catch up over a nice meal!","5","3/9/2019","133","Manolin","462 reviews","3621 Stone Way N","Seafood","http://yelp.com/biz/manolin-seattle","4"
"252","133","Seattle, known for its excellent food scene, is one of the top cities in the US to get great Seafood - and Manolin didn't disappoint. The most important part of great seafood is the quality of the fish, and I'm happy to share that each dish tasted as if our meal was caught just that morning. The restaurant also has a great open kitchen design so you can see the chefs prepare your meals. While the food and ambiance was great, Manolin still has room to work out a few kinks. The service was nothing better than decent and they need table bread for their dishes (they refused to give bread/chips for the ceviche, etc)!","4","9/17/2019","133","Manolin","462 reviews","3621 Stone Way N","Seafood","http://yelp.com/biz/manolin-seattle","4"
"253","133","Food: delishService: goodWe got lucky and didn't have to wait too long for a table, but even if we did wait - there is a great outdoor waiting area with a fire pit to keep you warm! It even has a server for drinks, so is like an upscale waiting lounge that's outside!Our friends had been there before and ordered for us. All of the food was fresh and flavorful. Items we liked include: Rockfish Ceviche (you'll want 1/2ppl), Albacore, Tuscan Kale, Iberico Pork Ribs, and Mussels (not unique to this spot, but they were fresh!).The menu isn't big so I want to come back to try the rest. Looking for my pictures to add to the review, will update my post!","5","5/24/2019","133","Manolin","462 reviews","3621 Stone Way N","Seafood","http://yelp.com/biz/manolin-seattle","4"
"254","133","My experience at Manolin's was a really nice one!The interior design of the spot was really hip/pretty and I really liked the soft blue tones, which fit well with the whole seafood theme. My boyfriend and I planned on coming around 4pm because they have happy hour Tues-Sun 4-6PM, but we ended up coming a bit after 5PM. Try to go before 5PM!!! The oyster happy hour deals are 1/2 off (4-5PM) and 1/4 off (5-6PM). For the entire 4-6PM hours, it'll be $2 off fish section on the menu and $2 off house cocktails though, but still.. after tasting these oysters, you're just going to want to order more and wish they were all 1/2 off. Between the Glacier Point and the Shigoku oyster, my boyfriend and I liked the Shigoku oyster more - although not as plump, it was sweeter! Both were still delicious, though. But seriously, great happy hour - it's rare to find a restaurant (esp. a good one) that has happy hours on the weekends.Food-wise, we tried to take advantage of the $2 off fish portion of the menu, so we ordered the Rockfish Ceviche, the Albacore, and the Mussels. We really liked the Rockfish Ceviche and the Mussels - the ceviche is really refreshing, but the mussels are so meaty and come in this rich yellow sauce on sourdough bread.. it's a nice contrast between the two. The Albacore was good and unique with its coconut & mango additions, but was not up to par with the other two. We also had a "treat yourself" moment and also decided to pick something off the grill portion of the menu too, in which we decided on the Spanish Octopus. To be honest, we thought this dish was okay. The octopus comes out fried like tempura and it's crunchy and not bad, but it just tasted like any other tempura to me, compared to the other unique dishes full of flavor. Probably wouldn't order this one again.Overall though, we really enjoyed this restaurant. It was cute, cozy, and the food was of high quality. Not only that, but it's also near Gas Works Park (our fav scenic landmark), so if you're done eating, go continue the fun & check that place out nearby!","4","9/5/2018","133","Manolin","462 reviews","3621 Stone Way N","Seafood","http://yelp.com/biz/manolin-seattle","4"
"255","133","The food at Manolin was quite average.The rockfish ceviche was good, but felt lacking in some acidity or bite. It was still not bad by any means, but felt like something I could whip together myself. The black rice with squid was extremely salty. Other than that, the rice had a great crunchy texture, while the squid was rubbery. I didn't end up finishing it due to the saltiness.","3","10/18/2019","133","Manolin","462 reviews","3621 Stone Way N","Seafood","http://yelp.com/biz/manolin-seattle","4"
"256","133","Came here with my family on my sister's recommendation because we were looking for happy hour oyster deals!Got here right at 4 and we were seated outside since the weather was lovely. They had two kinds of local oysters available that day so we got a dozen each. It was 50% off for oysters, and $2 off fish dish so we obviously took advantage of that. We got the rockfish ceviche which was refreshing and appetizing. My favorite was the mussels on toast! It was creamy and hearty. Overall a great place for happy hour and all their seafood items were fresh and yummy!","4","7/18/2018","133","Manolin","462 reviews","3621 Stone Way N","Seafood","http://yelp.com/biz/manolin-seattle","4"
"257","133","Someone recommended this neighborhood so we looked up a few places and this one stood out mostly because we wanted seafood. The place itself feels more trendy/hipster playing their 1970's 'yacht rock' tunes. We started with the rockfish ceviche which I liked but my wife could do without. We both enjoyed the plantain chips. The squid rice was surprisingly good especially since I don't seek out rice. The halibut was a bit disappointing. I think sometimes less is better and, in this case, not having the sauce would probably make this a better dish.We hit happy hour so we were able to get a few deals. Overall, I felt like the portions were pretty small for the dollar amount attached to them. Also, this place is rather small so expect a wait - we sat outside for about 20 minutes, which isn't bad, but we were also there during an off time.","4","3/29/2019","133","Manolin","462 reviews","3621 Stone Way N","Seafood","http://yelp.com/biz/manolin-seattle","4"
"258","133","A M A Z I N G.FOOD (5/5)My friend and I tried their oysters, the rockfish ceviche, and the black rice with squid and OMG, it was all so delicious! The oysters were satisfying for sure and I don't have a lot of experience with oysters to be completely honest, but I liked it (had it with the lemon and vinegar sauce)! The rockfish ceviche was SOO good and probably our favorite. The combination of flavors was light but unique for ceviche. With the sweet potato, rockfish, avocado and lime, it was BOMB. We also really liked the black rice with squid! It looked a little like a black bean patty at first and tasted a little charred but the flavors of the squid and lemon stuck out and the texture of the rice finished the dish off nicely. I'd also say that the presentation of all the dishes was A+.SERVICE (3/5)My only complaint is that the service was a touch slow on our waiter's side. We were seated in the outside patio area so maybe that's why but we had to wait for a bit to get our waters filled and for our check to be taken. ENVIRONMENT (5/5)Such a great restaurant vibe! Love that the floor plan is super open to the outdoors and that it opens out also to a standing area for Sea Wolf (? Not sure since there was an engagement party/gathering there). Super cute outdoor string lights add the perfect touch to this Fremont gem.","5","8/5/2018","133","Manolin","462 reviews","3621 Stone Way N","Seafood","http://yelp.com/biz/manolin-seattle","4"
"259","133","Shocked by all of the amazing reviews, and hoping I experienced manolin on an off night based on what others have said. Over all, the food did not deliver and was super disappointing.Here's what we ordered:Plantain chips- not fresh or warm. Had multiple bowls sitting on the counter and just grabbed one once we ordered.Ceviche - incredibly sour. Sour to the point where I could not continue eating. The flavors did not meld together nicely at all. Kohlrabi salad - one of the best things we ordered but again extremely sour tastingSmoked salmon with potato salad - this dish was awful. Had powdered carrot on top of the salmon. Tasted and smelled horrid.Kale salad with pickle,cotija and sunchoke - another favorite, but again flavors did not meld. The pickle was overwhelming to the salad.Ribs - very sweet and accompaniments were undercookedOverall, the flavors did not mesh well in the dishes and most tasted like they had not been pre-tasted by kitchen before being served.

"262","134","Do not come to this location for Ba Bar - better yet, if you want actually good Vietnamese food that doesn't cost an arm or a leg, go anywhere else. I probably would have given them a one star but the food overall wasn't terrible, just the service and everything else.We came here last night (Sunday night) for dinner around 6:30pm. Half the restaurant was empty including a fairly empty bar, yet there were at least a dozen people waiting to be seated. Our best assumption was that they were extremely low staffed, but how can you be so poorly staffed on a Sunday night?! They should have suggested to people that the bar was open seating at the very least. We had to check on our names multiple times to get any kind of update. When we finally got seated, no one came over to greet us or take drink orders or anything. We had to eventually flag down the host person to ask for our waiter so we can order. For food, we ordered the honey chicken wings and fresh spring rolls with shrimp and pork to share and we all got pho for entrees. I thought it was really weird that our waiter kept asking each person if they wanted tendon, and then I noticed that it's not included in any of the pho dishes and it's an add on for an additional $3.30! Which is INSANE. Who pays an extra $3.50 for tendon?! Luckily two of us said no but my friend didn't realize it was an add on and said yes cuz she thought it was already included so she felt tricked. So basically her oxtail pho was $19! The food overall was decent. The bowls of pho could have been bigger. The pho was extremely overpriced at $12.50-$15.50/bowl depending on which one you ordered. I guess this is what you get for Vietnamese fusion food. We also ordered two drinks - 1 bubble tea and 1 sparkling rose. They somehow forgot about the rose and we had to remind them after all our food came. Basically, don't come here for pho or Vietnamese food in general. There's so many better places in Seattle! (like Pho Bac sup shop)","2","9/23/2019","134","Ba Bar","263 reviews","2685 NE 46th St","Vietnamese","http://yelp.com/biz/ba-bar-seattle-7","3"
"263","134","Aside from a nice ambiance with an open air feel this place a lot of troubles going on. First off, while the open air feeling is nice, there are flies all over the place. The whole night we were swatting them away. Not only annoying but unappetizing. Initially service was good. Our server greeted us kindly and was attentive but once our orders were taken and food served (actually by a different staff member) he was gone. Multiple times were flagged him down to bring more water but that never happened. I finally had to get up and go grab the hostess for water. Food was so-so. The Vermicelli bowls are good but pretty standard. All of the different fresh roll appetizers are pretty bland and the imperial rolls were no better than a Panda Express equivalent. The rockfish special of the night was decent. I enjoyed the cabbage salad it came with but this fish fillet was full of bones. And if I haven't enticed you enough (joking), hands down the worst meal of the night is the Garlic Crab Noodles. Did you say crab? Could you please direct me to where this said crab is? It was basically a heaping bowl of noodles lacking any flavor or substance and literally a piece of crab.Returning? Me thinks not","2","8/29/2019","134","Ba Bar","263 reviews","2685 NE 46th St","Vietnamese","http://yelp.com/biz/ba-bar-seattle-7","3"

I ordered the bun bo hue (w/ added meatball & tendons.... must add) and wowwwww best bun bo hue I ever had! Broth was the PERFECT combination of spicy, salty... it warmed me to the soul. I have never had a blood cake before, but I definitely didn't hate it. I couldn't finish the good sized portion, but didn't mind-- i got to take the rest home! Oh, I also added the Chinese donut (so good! Semi crisp outside, super soft inside- perfect for soaking up the broth) Two thumbs up!

This seemed like a solid spot to wait for an Uber after the game. this was a modern Americanized Vietnamese  restaurant, with a not so impressive menu. Very limited in appetizers, small bites. But I ordered the fresh rolls and wings which seemed like a safe option. The fresh rolls were almost too minty to eat, they were good dipped in their speciality peanut/hoisin sauce. the wings did taste good but the smell of fish sauce was a lot stronger than your normal fish sauce chicken wings.

The broth was good, but it wasn't as hot as it normally should be. It was also FILLED with noodles so there barely was any broth. The vermicelli looked good, so maybe I will try that next time.","3","10/13/2019","134","Ba Bar","263 reviews","2685 NE 46th St","Vietnamese","http://yelp.com/biz/ba-bar-seattle-7","3"
"268","134","Besides the real sus food safety rating (needs to improve?!?!), the theme of this place is just confusing. They have Vietnamese food, modern American decor, Chinese characters on the menu, and New Orleans Cafe du Monde tins on the tables. Weird flex but ok. I came here with a group on a Wednesday night, and it was nice how accommodating they were since we came pretty late. Unfortunately, the menu had some fine print we missed saying that happy hour specials were only served at the bar. Although I wasn't planning on ordering anything off the happy hour section, that policy seems a little unreasonable. The pho tai nam I ordered was actually the first pho I'd ever eaten in my life. I thought it was decent, but I don't really have much of a baseline. The broth was flavorful and the portion was good for the price. Only 4 cards were allowed for the whole table, which made things a bit inconvenient. Our waitress seemed to have a lot of trouble splitting the checks since we had to subdivide into smaller groups to pay. I feel like it would've honestly been easier to have allowed everyone to pay for themselves with their own card.","2","7/7/2019","134","Ba Bar","263 reviews","2685 NE 46th St","Vietnamese","http://yelp.com/biz/ba-bar-seattle-7","3"
"269","134","I basically had two separate meals at this place in the same night and kind of had deja vu. I got dinner with a friend here and after dropping her off at the bus stop I went back and got a seat at a bar.For my (first) dinner I ordered the bun bo hue ($13.50) which was decent. I thought the broth was sweet and not very spicy at all. It wasn't very filling for me which was probably the reason why I decided to get a second dinner. I probably wouldn't order it again and would try the vermicelli next time because my friend ordered it and it looked good.For my (second) dinner I got a seat at the bar for their late night happy hour from 8-close. They also have all day specials on Sundays and Mondays which was perfect for me. I ordered the old fashioned which was solid especially since it was only $6. I also ordered the caipirinha which I was unfortunately not a fan at all. I ordered the Saigon chicken wings ($8.50) which were crispy and sweet and delicious. I also ordered the frites ($5) which was pretty bland and really nothing special. The dipping sauce was its saving grace but I didn't care much for it at all.Huge shoutout to my bartender Joe who was very welcoming and provided amazing service! I noticed that they had Chinese 5 spice bitters (something I've never seen before) and he mentioned they make it in-house for their Asian-inspired Manhattan which was really cool. He even let me try a sip of the carpano vermouth.","4","5/21/2019","134","Ba Bar","263 reviews","2685 NE 46th St","Vietnamese","http://yelp.com/biz/ba-bar-seattle-7","3"

"271","134","Our first time going to this location. We usually go to the one by Seattle U. This location is so much more spacious instead. Shared parking lot in the University Village, there's also garage parking. One of the surprising thing is that their food health rating is "Need to Improve". Makes us really wonder what's going on back there. But we've been to Ba Bar many times and never had food poisoning problems, not at this location this time either.We came here a few weeks ago on a weeknight after the first round of snowpocalypse, still the place was packed. There were about 5 other people in front of us. Hostess greeted us and asked if we minded a seat at the bar area. Husband and I were starving and agreed to the bar seating. It was one of the long high-top tables and we shared the table with a group of girlfriends already sitting there. The service at both locations are excellent. Very friendly.My husband ordered Bun Cha Ha Noi, came with grilled beef sausage, pork belly, papaya, veggies, and served with fresh herbs, lettuce and vermicelli noodles. While I got one of their specials that night, Garlic Crab Noodle. Our food took a really, really long time to come. Husband was sitting facing the kitchen area where the kitchen staff put the dishes that were ready to be sent to the tables, and he said that he saw our foods were sitting there for a good 20 minutes already. The servers obviously were super swamped and each time he walked by our table, he apologized for the delay and told us that he would give us a 10% off of our food. The food, despite delivered to our tables already room-temperature, were still really delicious. The noodles were cooked al dente, came with a few crab meat, in a soy garlic sauce. I actually really, really liked the noodle. I wish there were more crab meat in the dish. It was really delicious. Husband also enjoyed his dish thoroughly. For drink, I ordered their drink from their specials menu as well, called The Magic, served in a fun milk bottle shaped (but labeled bourbon whiskey lol). It's a little strong and I called it my adult milk drink. Husband ordered a bottle of beer. Bill came at about $56 before tips for the two of us, so I wouldn't call it cheap. But when we think of Ba Bar, they have become synonymous with "our place with comfort food". Specially the Seattle University's location that open super duper late (closes at 4am - yes you read that correctly). And it's become a tradition of ours for a dinner stop when we just returned to Seattle late at night from a one-day Portland road trip or after catching a red-eye flight.","4","4/2/2019","134","Ba Bar","263 reviews","2685 NE 46th St","Vietnamese","http://yelp.com/biz/ba-bar-seattle-7","3"

Also interesting that the server continued to correct my pronunciation of the dishes even though I'm Vietnamese, speak Vietnamese and I'm actually pronouncing them correctly with the correct accent...Pho ga tron: I'm not sure if this dish is just from a different region or Vietnam but I've never had it before. I like thicker rice noodles which was in this dish. Bo ne: the steak was nice and tender and the pate was rich and creamy Banh cuon: the meat was pretty fatty and I like that the actual banh cuon is made in houseCom tam: the fish sauce with the broken rice was much more sour than the fish sauce provided with the banh cuon.

"274","134","Horrible service! We came around 3pm on Tuesday and the restaurant was empty. Only 3-4 tables on the patio. The manager (I assume?) with brown mustaches, and another server already acknowledged our present but none of them gave us eyes contact or at least show us they care. We awkwardly stood in the front and being completely ignored for few minutes. That moment I really wanted to go to Joey right next door but my friends were craving for Viet food. I wasnt that hungry at all but first impression totally suck!Finally the mustaches guy came by, didnt smile, didnt say hi, just being fcking cold and rude. I said we want to sit on the patio, he walked us there and carelessly dropped the menu without saying anything (???) You are unable to talk or something???Then another server (Jennifer) appeared, she's  running around taking care of other tables but didn't even bother to look at us or at least say "I'll be with you in a moment" After 5 mins being forgotten even we tried to make eyes contact, she came to take orders with an attitude that couldn't be any less friendly. Food delivered after ~ 15mins but guess what only 3 dishes instead of 4. Two of my friends order the same dish but only one was ready (?) Jennifer said they're having problem with the grill or something. It's very awkward when one person is waiting for her food while others almost finish.I still tipped her 15% but I will never ever come back. The management sucks and manager is completely a dick! I noticed our server was seem to be friendly with other tables but not us! She smiled, joking around with them but with us, her attitude was totally different. Mind you the restaurant was hella empty and we tried to be as polite as possible. Is that because we look Asians and you don't like it?  You seemed to not happy to be a server so I suggest you should quit the job!I wanted to talk to the manager but didnt want to make a scene, just wanted to enjoy my day off as easy as possible. Because I know it will take to nowhere since the mustaches guy didnt give a fck about customers, so there's no reason they would take our feedback seriously.Bye Ba Bar, food at this location sucks (mediocre, tasteless), service sucks, we hate you and we won't spend a coin for your business anymore!","1","8/7/2019","134","Ba Bar","263 reviews","2685 NE 46th St","Vietnamese","http://yelp.com/biz/ba-bar-seattle-7","3"

I'll admit, it is a little pricier than other Vietnamese restaurants in the Seattle area and surrounding, but it's also in the U-District Shopping area, so is argue it's kinda expected... The food: there are a lot of gluten free options here! We had the crispy imperial rolls, the pho ga (chicken & egg), spicy pork belly rotisserie. The rolls were delicious, and came with fresh and pickled veggies and dipping sauce. The pho was good, nice and homey which I really enjoyed. The spicy pork wasn't so much spicy as it was sticky, but in a good way! I'd definitely try more food here! The service: it was really great!

"277","134","While walking around University Village, we decided to stop by Ba Bar for lunch, especially considering that it was voted as "Best in Washington" for Vietnamese eats. I don't frequent Vietnamese restaurants too often, but on this particular day, I was feeling a couple symptoms of a cold, so a hot bowl of noodle soup sounded quite comforting.The ambiance is rather trendy and modern with bright pops of color that liven up the dining area. I loved the look of the yellow posts that separate the bar from the rest of the room and the vibrant teal along the side windows. We were seated promptly and handed the menu which is essentially split into four main sections - small plates, vermicelli bowls, noodle soup and rotisserie items. There was also a menu of lunch specials with several options. The rotisserie duck sounded delicious, but I ultimately opted for the Pho Tai Nam.... a traditional bowl of pho with beef brisket and eye of round steak ($12). All four of us ordered a different type of pho. While my bowl came with a generous serving of noodles, and some bean sprouts, Thai basil leaves and jalapeno on the side, I was a little disappointed with the amount of beef included.  I found just a few paper thin slices of the steak and around 5-7 square pieces of brisket. The steak was delicious, cooked to a perfect medium and therefore didn't become overdone when dunked in the soup. I just wish there was more of it. The broth was soothing for my throat, being light with a full beefy flavor. Although all four of our bowls were served hot enough, we noticed they didn't come out with as much steam as those received by the table next to us. Usually with soup, I have to allow a few minutes for it to cool, but I was able to dig in right away. Most bowls of pho are between $12-15, which is on the steeper end. Overall, I enjoyed my lunch, but it wasn't memorable enough to differentiate Ba Bar's version from a beef pho at any other typical Vietnamese restaurant.Service was friendly and we were checked on at least a couple times during our meal, which was considerate as the lunch rush began picking up around noon. I'd be willing to try this restaurant again in the future for a taste of the rotisserie items and their famous crispy Imperial Rolls. We noticed that their King County health rating was "Needs to Improve" at the time, which honestly deterred us from ordering anything cold, such as the vermicelli bowls. I'd be more comfortable returning once they achieve  "Good" at the minimum, so we could at least consider all that their menu has to offer. 3.25 stars.","3","12/27/2018","134","Ba Bar","263 reviews","2685 NE 46th St","Vietnamese","http://yelp.com/biz/ba-bar-seattle-7","3"

"279","134","We went to the U village to get my husband's glasses adjusted and got hungry so tried this place.  The atmosphere was lively.  We ordered veggie fresh rolls, veggie vermicelli, and duck breast with rice.  It took quite some time for foid to come which was ok since it signaled to us that they cooked to order.  Veggie fresh rolls were tasty.  The mushroom made it flavorful.  The peanut sauce was good but it would have been better if it was warmed up.  Veggie vermicelli noodle was pretty good not the best.  I liked the fact that it wasn't too salty.  It had lots of veggies and mushrooms which was nice.Duck breast with broken rice was a disappointment per my hubby.  Rather than serving the breast like the menu stated, it included leg part.  This was misleading.  The broken rice was too dry.  He liked the candied pineapple slices.Service was at minimum.  The waiter didn't check to see how we liked the food.  He just took our orders and took our money.  They had different people bring out the food.  Overall we wouldn't go back there as the food wasn't any noteworthy for the price they charge.","3","6/9/2019","134","Ba Bar","263 reviews","2685 NE 46th St","Vietnamese","http://yelp.com/biz/ba-bar-seattle-7","3"

"283","135","Not a fan of their sauces or the way they get their chicken. I tried a sandwich and sandwich wasn't great but had some flavor. The chicken tenders were worse since it was dry white meat and because I didn't like any of the sauces. Tried three out of four sauces (didn't try ranch).Wait is also a bit long which would be okay if I liked the food.

"284","135","Saw this walk up window a few days ago. Decided to back track from Lake City late this Sunday afternoon, and head back to the UDistrict for some quality wings from Bok a Bok Fried Chicken (9/8/19). Turns out this was only Day 4 of service,  so very new at a former pizza spot.Friendly person at the window who took my  order of 20 wings, with four sauces. A pair each of 4 Chili Hot Sauce and Sesame Soy Garlic were my choices. Had a brief wait, took Yelp photos, and talked briefly about the Seahawks with another customer. Soon with my takeout bag of goodness in hand, drove back to Shoreline.Tasty, crispy, plump, juicy wings were still hot once arrived at home! Delicious. With tax and tip, this order was under $29. There are other Bok a Bok locations in Burien, White Center, Seattle/Capitol Hill, and now this walk up takeout window in Seattle/University District up at 52nd/UWay with a convenient adjacent tiny parking lot. Hopefully, another one can open in North Seattle or Shoreline. Until then, yay for this site opening. They have ample time to adjust to their new digs before the onslaught of UW students starting end of this month.","4","9/8/2019","135","Bok a Bok Fried Chicken","15 reviews","5201 University Way NE","Chicken Wings","http://yelp.com/biz/bok-a-bok-fried-chicken-seattle-9","3"
"285","135","They did not really have any dining area around the store so I did order for a takeout and decided to eat at home. Upon arrival, the order was first come first serve basis and there was only one person in front of me at lunch time. It did not take them that long to make my order which was a 5-piece chicken drumsticks and a side of biscuit drizzled in honey.Personally, I think 5 drumsticks was too much for a person because they were HUUGEE but they were delicious and fairly priced. I spent around $17 dollars for my order but the amount of fullness I get was unparalleled. Food wise, their fried chicken was american and asian inspired since the breading was different and I would describe to have a texture of chicken karage. The chicken was awesome but I did not like the biscuit at all since they were very bready and dry. I would probably try another sides if I am ever coming back.","4","9/26/2019","135","Bok a Bok Fried Chicken","15 reviews","5201 University Way NE","Chicken Wings","http://yelp.com/biz/bok-a-bok-fried-chicken-seattle-9","3"
"286","135","I was driving up and down the Ave in hunger, and this place caught my attention.  "Oh! A fried chicken place!"  *Proceed to check on Yelp* "And it's new!"  I was so hungry, fried chicken sounded really good, and I decided to give it a try.  I was totally ready to go into the restaurant and also borrow their restroom while waiting for my food, only to find out that this location is *takeout only*.  To those seeking bathroom breaks during lunch/dinner, you've been warned.  I ordered the spicy friend chicken sandwich.  Girl at the counter had no problem with taking my order but had a hard time making sure nothing inside goes flying outta the window into the wind and rain (aka typical Seattle weather).  I did not have to wait very long for my food, though there were only 2-3 people before me.  The fried chicken itself was done quite well.  It was super crispy on the outside, and the hot sauce was the right amount.  I don't remember the inside being super juicy, but it definitely was not dry.  I would say it's a fair to good price for the food and will come again (when I am not in a hurry to use a bathroom).  I wish this location will expand into a sit-down restaurant!","4","9/22/2019","135","Bok a Bok Fried Chicken","15 reviews","5201 University Way NE","Chicken Wings","http://yelp.com/biz/bok-a-bok-fried-chicken-seattle-9","3"
"287","135","This place is really new, and you can kind of tell. The staff is a bit flustered and not the most experienced with the technology they use. The food also took a while, but they were a bit busy. However, the staff is incredibly nice and are very happy to help. They just need a bit of time to work some of the kinks out, but I'll still be coming!I ordered the bulgogi chicken tacos, and it was only okay. To be fair, they're more known for fried chicken, but I didn't want anything too heavy. I am curious to try their fried chicken sandwiches! Anyway, back to the tacos. The tortillas were a bit too thick for my liking and the sauce was a bit salty. The other filling was really good! The lettuce was fresh and had a nice crunch to balance the soft tortilla and tender chicken. It's really just the flavor of the sauce and the tortilla that didn't make this taco so good.Right now the rating is how it is when it first opened, but I'm sure it'll get better as they learn with this opening period. I'll come back a couple more times to try their other, more well-known items, but as of right now, this place is only alright.","3","9/7/2019","135","Bok a Bok Fried Chicken","15 reviews","5201 University Way NE","Chicken Wings","http://yelp.com/biz/bok-a-bok-fried-chicken-seattle-9","3"

"290","135","I have come here several times now and this place has shown to be a good and consistent fried chicken place. The fried chicken itself is nice, crispy, and juicy. The sauces aren't my absolute favorite, but they get the job done. The sandwiches are good too - occasionally they overdo the amount of sauce on the sandwich, so it ends up being too salty, but it's usually not a problem. The only thing is that they do have a tendency to get backed up with orders, so expect to wait for your order if you don't order ahead of time. For the most part - the people their are also very nice and helpful, there have only been a couple of workers there that may be a bit standoffish but not rude or anything.

I ordered on Caviar and only recieved half my order, the chicken I did receive was undercooked, and the ginger coleslaw - my favorite at their other locations - was somehow both slimey and fermented.

"296","136","I made Pair my first stop in Seattle after seeing pictures of their banana bread pudding, which is my all-time favorite dessert. I seek it out wherever I go, and Yelp did not leave me astray this time. The restaurant has a very quaint, warm feel. On the Sunday night that I visited, almost every table was taken. Thankfully I was seated as a table of one without a reservation, and my server quickly brought me water. I ordered the halibut, which came out with a delicious albeit tiny piece of fish over a delicious risotto.  I knew the bread pudding was coming for dessert so I held off on other dishes, but I was eyeing my neighbors buratta big time. Thankfully, the bread pudding was just as tasty as I had hoped.","5","8/4/2019","136","Pair","232 reviews","5501 30th Ave NE","American (New)","http://yelp.com/biz/pair-seattle","4"
"297","136","Pair is a quaint bistro in Ravenna neighborhood- wonderful spot! We were seated right away with reservations- restaurant is small, so highly recommend booking in advance.Overall, the food quality and flavors were outstanding, but certain things didnt allow the 5 star rating. I knew the portion sizes were small from other reviews, and I was excited to try lots of different things... however, small means really small! We had a party of 6 and most of the items allowed maybe 1 bite from each plate. For $15-$25 per plate, we should get more than 5-6 bites...As for the food: highlights for me were the Burrata app, Pork, Gnocchi, and Pumpkin Ravioli! Flavors were bursting off the fork and I wish we had ordered more plates... both of the steak items (frites and brisket) were good, but not as good as the others. The cocktail list was really small - we decided to go with wine only that we had brought. Pair could step up their game in that department. Last comment to the restaurant - our server was lovely, but we had to keep asking to replace the empty water bottle or open a new bottle of wine - those are important service items when we are dropping hundreds of dollars at tour restaurant!Final verdict - some nitpicky items, but definitely come here for a great evening.","4","10/20/2019","136","Pair","232 reviews","5501 30th Ave NE","American (New)","http://yelp.com/biz/pair-seattle","4"

The service is pleasant and the space is very charming. It's like one big room with everyone eating in the living room sort of. It hits neighborhood spot on the nail.

Service was really good and food and drink came out fast for such a large table. Everything was reasonably priced and the options were tasty. With all the various dietary restrictions our group had it was nice that there was something for everyone. We had a couple orders of the fondue (a must!!) And I had the mussels and frites (another must at a French restaurant!) The mussels were so fresh and lacked any of that fishy seawater taste that can be found pretty much everywhere else mussels are served.

"301","136","Quaint, romantic, and cozy are my first impressions of Pair. The unassuming interior yields a rustic French farmhouse ambience. We were celebrating a friend's birthday and they were very accommodating with our large group. We started with a couple bottles of 2016 Réserve de Générac Costières de Nimes, Syrah/Grenache. We also ordered a couple of Cambozola fondue to share. The fondue had a nice blend of Camembert and Gorgonzola. The wine paired nicely with the fondue. I ordered the the steak frites for my main entree. This restaurant uses small plates which gives the dishes a smaller appearance. The steak was a perfect medium rare. The blue cheese chive butter and red jus were a nice touch. I'll be bookmarking this restaurant for future date nights. Here are a few things to remember when if you are planning on dining at Pair:1.) Make reservations. This does get packed especially in the weekends. 2.) No show fee for large party reservations is $20.00/head3.)

Meat was very well prepared for both dishes and served in delicious meat broths/sauces.  Note that the steak frites consisted of a nice cut, likely filet mignon. Roasted 1/2 chicken had an excellent crunch to the skin, without excessive oil.

"306","136","I had been meaning to check out Pair for a while, especially since it wasn't too far from where we lived. I made reservations for restaurant week on a Thursday at 6 pm. Parking wasn't too bad. The neighborhoods around have some street parking around, especially since it was an early Thursday night. When we got in, the place was already pretty packed. It's not a big place, I would highly recommend reservations as other reviewers have already mentioned. We were seated pretty quickly, and they took our jackets, which was a nice touch. We ordered from the restaurant week menu. I started with the green salad, main entree was the brisket with duck fat potatoes, and for dessert the banana bread pudding. Boyfriend got the asparagus soup, the risotto, and the banana bread pudding as well. We also decided to get the pickle tray to start. Boyfriend also got an Old Fashion while I decided on a Tequila Sunrise. The drinks were good. I'm a huge fan of tequila, and they did a good job with putting in a good amount of tequila where I could still taste it yet it wasn't overpowering. The food came out at a good time, the waiter who brought out our food knew when we were done and would quickly clear our plates and bring out our next course.The bread they brought out beforehand was good, pretty standard. The pickle tray was a little laughable. It was a small bowl of just a couple of pickle things. Really not worth it. It was a bit of a let down. The pickles were okay, nothing memorable. I liked the green salad with the chevre toast. The dressing was light, and the chevre toast paired well with the salad. My boyfriend's asparagus soup was light and springy. My brisket was good, again, pretty standard. Nothing too memorable. I wasn't a huge fan of my boyfriends risotto, but he liked it. I thought it lacked flavor although it was cooked well. We were both let down by the banana bread pudding. They didnt put enough custard all over the banana bread, so the corners were just dried out banana bread. It was crunchy and kind of ruined it for us. Service is quick and efficient. Although when we left, nobody gave us our jackets, so we just grabbed them from the coat rack with all the other coats ourselves. It's a cute, trendy place. Food was honestly just average for me. It was also pretty loud in there. We could barely hear each other over the couple's next to us first date conversation. Pair is definitely not one of my first choices. If a friend wanted to go, I wouldn't be opposed to it, but I probably wouldn't come here by my own choice.","3","4/22/2018","136","Pair","232 reviews","5501 30th Ave NE","American (New)","http://yelp.com/biz/pair-seattle","4"
"307","136","The food was tasty, but as others have mentioned, the portions were tiny. My major complaint is that there is large price discrepancy between the menu prices listed on yelp and their website, and what was actually on the menu today. For example, steak frites is currently listed on yelp/their website as $15, and in person it was listed as $20. This was true for many of the other items. I understand menus are subject to change, but it did give me false expectations.I ordered the Black Old Fashioned, which was a little floral-tasting for my preference. For food my husband and I ordered off the Happy Hour menu: kale salads, brisket sliders, fontina mac and cheese, patatas bravas, and the $2 olives. The best bang for your buck is the mac and cheese. It is still small but more filling and so creamy!  Potato apps are usually larger, so I would have liked the patatas bravas to be much bigger. Everything was delicious!Our banana bread pudding was a little crispy and nearly charred, as seen in my photo. Based on others' photos hopefully this is not the norm. Service was friendly and fairly fast. We did not have to wait for a table. I would appreciate if the menu prices were updated so that I can make a well informed decision about coming here again.","3","5/12/2018","136","Pair","232 reviews","5501 30th Ave NE","American (New)","http://yelp.com/biz/pair-seattle","4"

Oh, and bread pudding was also perfect. Really my only complaint would be that we thought the steak portion was half what we would expect.Overall, we decided this could be a regular spot for us. Thanks, Pair!","5","6/5/2019","136","Pair","232 reviews","5501 30th Ave NE","American (New)","http://yelp.com/biz/pair-seattle","4"
"309","136","Loved this neighborhood place. Great chef, drinks, food. Live right by it. Unfortunately, we called in to see if a table was open at anytime Friday and they said one was just opening up and no one was waiting do if we came right down in 5 minutes they would let us have it-even though they don't really hold tables. She then took my name! We said "We'll be right there! Thanks so much." So we threw on our jackets and made it down the street in record time. When we arrived, the lady I spoke to on the phone, who offered me this without my asking, the hostess, seated a party of 3 right in front of us and then told us there were no tables! We could wait 20plus minutes and wait for a table or have a drink at the bar! So Sorry/ not sorry! I guess. Now you're here and you can drink, Thanks so much! Why do this? When pressed she said " Yes, I apologize. It's was my fault!" So that's just dandy. I always mistakenly thought the sign said "Pain" and now that's played out for us.","2","3/29/2019","136","Pair","232 reviews","5501 30th Ave NE","American (New)","http://yelp.com/biz/pair-seattle","4"

"311","136","A tiny restaurant that fills up fast.Luckily I got the last 2 top table in the place because the wait after me was 45 minutes. The food was okay. We ordered:- olives - too marinated and cooked- lamb with corn bread and BBQ sauce - the lamb and corn bread were pretty good but the sauces were not.- tator tots - decent but could rethink the sauces with them- vegetarian cassoulet - very dry - kale salad - good but small - bread - standard- cocktail - the tequila one was good- banana bread pudding - delicious!The waitress was good and attentive. We were there a while and they definitely wanted us to go since there was a big line still. I'd come back to try more items and this is one of the few nicer restaurants in the neighborhood.","3","11/17/2018","136","Pair","232 reviews","5501 30th Ave NE","American (New)","http://yelp.com/biz/pair-seattle","4"
"312","136","Hard to rate them, maybe 3.5 stars. My main entree was a bit disappointing but the rest was very good. I thought steak and frites would be a good way to go at this type of restaurant. I don't like blue cheese so didn't get the blue cheese butter on top. The steak flavor was lacking almost bland even with the wine reduction sauce not what I expect for the price of the entree. I did enjoy the fries though. The good parts were that the sweet potato soup was great and I also enjoyed the chocolate flourless cake. Open to trying again sometime.","3","11/4/2018","136","Pair","232 reviews","5501 30th Ave NE","American (New)","http://yelp.com/biz/pair-seattle","4"
"313","136","This was a really nice little neighborhood restaurant. We celebrated my friends 50th birthday. Because it was small plates we had a chance to sample a variety of the food. My favorite dish I had for dinner was the cod. We also ordered brussels sprouts which I would probably pass on next time. I've had better at other places. I died with a bunch of boys who enjoyed the sliders and the mac & cheese. Prepare to order lots of small plates as the portions are just that...small. It won't be an inexpensive dinner you might expect if you look at the menu, but worth it. The absolute best thing about this place though, was the Pavlova with lemon curd that I had for dessert. The desserts overall  were very very good., we pretty much ordered one of each! I would go back just for that Pavlova. Our waiter had a dry but enjoyable sense of humor. The restaurant was really dark so it was hard to get good pictures.","4","3/1/2019","136","Pair","232 reviews","5501 30th Ave NE","American (New)","http://yelp.com/biz/pair-seattle","4"
"314","136","My friends and I got dinner here tonight. The exterior is quaint and unassuming, and the inside is much larger than one might expect and light and airy.We were immediately seated around 5pm on a Friday without a reservation. Happy hour happened to be 5-6pm, so we each started with a glass of the house white wine ($6 on happy hour). Our waiter was so gracious and lovely and waited while we hemmed and hawwed over what we wanted to try. We got:- complementary bread (they bring this out to you without asking) - perfectly crusty and chewy- herb and cheese puffs (on happy hour) - amazing, a little dense for my liking, but the perfect carby, cheesey, bite- baby kale Caesar (on happy hour) - so good that even my friend who hates kale loves this salad. There were croutons and olives in it which were perfect complements to the homemade Caesar dressing- moules frites - giant bowl of mussels in a rich broth topped with a pile of fries. Their fries were a little oily, a little salty, a little soft, a little crunchy - just the way I like it. The waiter brought us ketchup and aioli for dipping. - the salmon special - piece of grilled salmon with vegetables and a nutty creme fraiche. A rather small portion, but holy yum. The fish was cooked perfectly.All in total after tax and a 20% tip, the 3 of us gals paid $28. For a glass of wine and all that food, amazing service, ambiance - what a great deal!!!","5","7/27/2018","136","Pair","232 reviews","5501 30th Ave NE","American (New)","http://yelp.com/biz/pair-seattle","4"

"316","137","I spend a lot of time in the U district. Of the many lunch spots there, Little Thai has been one of our favorite go-to places for the past 10 years. And I'm someone who won't return to a restaurant that didn't completely satisfy me. Little Thai is Consistently good. I especially love the mixed seafood with glass noodles. More seafood than you'd expect. (Unfortunately the salmon special that used to incredibly delicious is no longer that great.) Friendly service. A free meal after buying 10.

"319","137","Came across this place just walking around U-District area. I decided to order their "all day combo". The dish came with: tofu curry, pad thai, steamed rice, and an egg roll. It was the perfect meal for me because I can be indecisive when choosing what to eat. The food was also really good and flavorful. The best part is that the meal was only $10! It filled me up and I ended up saving most of my pad Thai for a later snack. Overall, I would come back here to try other things.","4","10/16/2019","137","Little Thai Restaurant","345 reviews","4142 Brooklyn Ave NE","Thai","http://yelp.com/biz/little-thai-restaurant-seattle","4"
"320","137","Little Thai serves the widest variety of Thai dishes on the Ave, everything from noodles to curries to rice dishes to savory pancakes and desserts. I've been coming here for the past three years and they have been a consistently reliable restaurant for when my Thai food cravings hit.Today, I ordered a 2 star (note that Little Thai uses a spiciness range of 1 to 3 stars) Beef Pad See Ew to go. With tax, the total came out to $10.95 (much more reasonable than Noodle Nation). Personally, I thought the 2 Star was really mild and ended up adding my own chili paste when I got home... However, I've  gotten a 3 Star Spicy Drunken Noodles before, and that was very hot, so I guess it depends on the dish.Like most Thai restaurants, portions are small for the price. However, the noodles were flavorful and not overly sweet or greasy. I wish that they included more vegetables, but it was enough to complement the noodles. As far as service goes, the owner is very friendly and will also give you recommendations. Her favorite dish is apparently the Spicy Thai noodles which she describes as wide noodles with a sour and savory chili sauce. Ive never had it before, but I'll have to give it a go next time! They are also quick, at least for takeout orders; I was in and out of the restaurant in less than 15 minutes.Overall, Little Thai's selection of food is more than enough to satisfy the taste buds of both the average and adventurous Thai food lovers. I will be back for lunch again soon.","4","2/14/2019","137","Little Thai Restaurant","345 reviews","4142 Brooklyn Ave NE","Thai","http://yelp.com/biz/little-thai-restaurant-seattle","4"
"321","137","When I was still a student, my Thai roommate would take me out to this place very often because they serve some of the most authentic Thai dishes in the neighborhood. My go-to is the fried fish in red curry. It's delectable. The fish is fried to perfection and then mixed with savory red curry.In my last visit, I was incredibly disappointed with the service. The male server handed me my bill while I was not even halfway through my meal. And he did not say anything. He just placed the bill on my table while I was enjoying my fish. He did not refill my water. I was used to one of the servers walking around the restaurant, greeting everybody, and asking how we liked the food. But there's none of that this time. It breaks my heart to give this place three stars because I have very fond memories of this location.

We both got All Day Combos. I got it because I couldn't decide whether I wanted curry or go for phad thai. I should really branch out and stop ordering phad thai... but it's one of my favorite dishes. The only thing I didn't really like was the eggroll. I also thought it was a little funny that we got sauce plates just for that one, 2 inch long egg roll. I wouldn't say it was special, but it was hearty, yummy, and generously portioned.

I got my meal before my husband and no one checked on us after the food was served. No refills on drinks were offered either.The biggest con to me is the dirty walls with food splash all over.

Tofu is a pretty common ingredient so it didn't feel like anything was missing!Pineapple Fried Rice: while the flavors were mainly good, I felt like it wasn't quite complete. The tofu didn't really add much to it. (Admittedly liked it 10x better when I ate it for leftovers the next day with some bacon)Vegetable Tempura: pretty good with the sauce that comes with it. Interesting choice of veggies, not your typical Japanese ones.Drunken Mushroom: Wowow this was good. My favorite dish of them all. It's pad kee mao on a whole 'nother level. Can definitely understand why it's their signature dish. So flavorful and each part of the dish works well. Would definitely get it again and it's actually a lot better than a lot of non-vegan drunken noodles I've had before!Only qualm is the pricing for single dishes. While portions are good sizes, kind of hard to imagine pricing when veggies and carbs make up a strong proportion of the ingredients.

A sweet honey glaze sauce was provided for dipping.The kitchen closes at 9:15pm and the restaurant closes at 9:30 on a Monday just as an fyi. We ultimately chose to share 4 dishes family style. The dishes were red curry, green curry, spicy noodle and pad thai.Everything was vegetarian and super delicious. The big winner was the red curry in my opinion. Perfect balance of coconut and spice.Decor is really nice inside, vines everywhere! Bar is very small and drinks are a little on the expensive side.THE FINAL BAMBOO: A little pricey for just vegetable dishes, however very tasty. Spent around $38 including tip and tax.

The entrees we ordered were No. S-7 Mango Salad, No. 44 Spicy Noodle, No. 57 Drunken Mushroom, and No. 59 Massaman Banana Curry. Everything's PERFECT. Trust me, I'm not even exaggerating. I'm a big meat lover when eating out, but the food here was so delicious that meat or no meat didn't even matter any more. Recommendation: even though everything was impressively delicious, some dish still stood out. I tried my friend's No. 59 Mssaman Banana Curry - it blew my mind. Honestly when I saw it on the menu, it didn't look attractive to me at all. I'm really glad that my friend ordered it so I got to try it, because it was simply so creative and so amazing. Give it a try and you'll know what I'm talking about!Warning: when they say spicy, they mean it. I'm usually pretty good at eating spicy food but man, the mango salad with spicy level of 4 bombed my mouth. I'm 120% sure that I'm coming back!!!","5","3/10/2019","138","Araya's Place","380 reviews","5240 University Way NE","Thai","http://yelp.com/biz/arayas-place-seattle-2","4"

"350","138","Having a vegan body-builder as a brother presents a high bar for a restaurant: in addition to great food, service, and atmosphere, we want lots of veggie options, large portions, and healthy dishes. Araya's simply delivers on all fronts, and though we keep trying other places, it's been our family's favorite restaurant for years now. The menu is huge, with a wide selection of stir fries, noodle dishes, soups, salads, and curries. But don't let that worry you! Deliciousness is consistent throughout. Highlights include their fried Brussels sprouts, stir fried eggplant, pumpkin curry, and, of course, their $13 lunch buffet with a dozen different dishes. The restaurant is bright and airy, the prices are great, and service is always fast. This isn't just a vegan/vegetarian spot, but a great Thai choice in a crowded Seattle market.","5","9/8/2019","138","Araya's Place","380 reviews","5240 University Way NE","Thai","http://yelp.com/biz/arayas-place-seattle-2","4"

The food was hot and freshly made, you could taste the freshness and the crunch of the produce as the flavors assimilate. Felt as if basil was used too much though I wouldn't want to complain about it.Service was gracious and quick, many options to try in the appetizer and the soups were appealing which usually doesn't happen with me.Will come back to try more !.","3","6/23/2019","138","Araya's Place","380 reviews","5240 University Way NE","Thai","http://yelp.com/biz/arayas-place-seattle-2","4"
"352","138","very clean, welcoming, & aesthetic thai restaurant near uw! i came here with my friend who is vegetarian, so this was a perfect place offering many vegan/vegetarian options for her. there were barely any people (maybe 1 or 2 other parties) when we got there around 5pm on a weekday so we were seated promptly. my friend and i both ordered the gluten-free phad thai noodles ($11.95). food came out fast and and portion size was plentiful! service was also quick and satisfying. we probably spent a hour max at the restaurant - the majority of the time spent eating and talking; we were never sitting around waiting for anything but neither were we being rushed out of our seats. the server also refilled our water several times. overall, the people, service and ambiance is wonderful. i would give this place 4-4.5 stars but probably not a full 5, though, because it's just not the best thai food i've had. i personally thought the phad thai was a bit too salty (maybe too much oyster sauce?) and the noodles were slightly thicker and chewier than i'm use to. if you don't have a restrictive diet, i really like thaiger room on the ave. they have really good chicken phad thai with huge portions for a great price!","4","8/8/2019","138","Araya's Place","380 reviews","5240 University Way NE","Thai","http://yelp.com/biz/arayas-place-seattle-2","4"

Had a wonderful experience, and plan to visit again sometime. At the time I felt like the portions were a bit small, but at the quality and caliber they serve, it is well worth the price tag when its not restaurant week.The restaurant is a charming and beautiful space well fit for a date night or special occasion, but also a casual (but nice) dinner out with friends. The staff is very friendly, patient, and attentive - high marks all around!Every dish I tried was phenomenal and has just left me wanting to go back and try more. I'll either be back soon, or at the very least during the next restaurant week, and I recommend you do the same.

"357","139","Have no idea why this place has a high rating. The food is very mediocre and overpriced. We ordered Ahi Tuna Crudo, Ricotta ravioli , Wagyu Beef Crusted with Peppercorn and RosemaryThe chili oil in the tuna Ahi tuna crudo tastes too strong &overpowering and the tuna is not very fresh because the mouth feel is weird. The portion of the pasta is small the taste is very mediocre. For less than $40 I did not expect the steak to be a real Wagyu but even as a regular steak its taste is disappointing.","2","8/4/2019","139","mkt.","309 reviews","2108 N 55th St","American (New)","http://yelp.com/biz/mkt-seattle","4"
"358","139","Excellent food and service. This ESR gem hit out of the park. We really enjoyed the burrata, gnocchi and steak. We got the carrots too but they were not my favorite as they were underdone and there were too many breadcrumbs on top. We had a beautiful red wine blend that had ESR in the name. This restaurant made us wish we lived in the neighborhood so that we could casually walk out to the outside counter and order up something divine. The restaurant was very busy and also very small. This made very warm inside despite sitting somewhat closer to the door.","4","5/19/2019","139","mkt.","309 reviews","2108 N 55th St","American (New)","http://yelp.com/biz/mkt-seattle","4"

You get every item listed under "First Course" and then it's one choice per person for the main course and dessert. The portions might be considered small, but everything was delicious! The green beans had a nice, grilled taste to it. The beets salad was flavorful and had a nice wine vinaigrette. The potato gnocchi was warm and moist on the inside. All in all it was a great meal.

"360","139","I've been to Mkt a couple of times, most recently for Restaurant Week. I think a lot of the Ethan Stowell restaurants are overrated but this one is a gem. It's very small though so be prepared to make a reservation and sit close to the kitchen and your neighbors. Also in case you're worried, parking is usually pretty easy in the Tangletown neighborhood.","5","11/12/2019","139","mkt.","309 reviews","2108 N 55th St","American (New)","http://yelp.com/biz/mkt-seattle","4"
"361","139","Something to note about me is that I take Seattle Restaurant Week very very seriously.. This is probably my 3rd or 4th year partaking and after scouring menus and consulting yelp reviews and photos, my friend and I decided on mkt. for our first visit of this round.This was my first time at mkt., and I was happy upon arriving that parking was incredibly easy to find. mkt. is super cute inside, but pretty tiny! They fit a lot of tables in the space and you have to be super careful while getting in/out of your seat to not bump into the tables next to you.For SRW, mkt. does "for the table" appetizers, meaning everyone at your table gets a small individual portion of each option. I love this idea because there is no decision-making and no possibility of order regret (the worst). Each appetizer was tasty and was brought out at a nice pace. For the entree, I chose the steak which was cooked perfectly and the tempura-style fried mushrooms that came with were really yummy. I chose the chocolate panna cotta for dessert, which I liked despite not being a huge sweets person. I also have to commend the service. We overheard a table near us being really difficult with the servers, and I was impressed at how calmly and gracefully they reacted to the situation.","5","4/10/2019","139","mkt.","309 reviews","2108 N 55th St","American (New)","http://yelp.com/biz/mkt-seattle","4"
"362","139","Came here for restaurant week.  The outstanding dishes was the burrata with cured ham on bread as well as the chocolate panna Cotta and lemon tart.  The texture of the panna Cotta was unique and the lemon tart wasn't too sweet.  For the entree, we ordered the scallops and lasagna.  Tbh the lasagna was definitely sitting around for a bit.  Reminded me of grade school lasagna with a reheated cheese top.  The scallops were executed well but the way it was seasoned wasn't outstanding, rather simple.  The appetizers at the beginning were plentiful lots of greens.  We had a salad, green beans in a cup as well as a cold pea soup and hamachi crudo.  Definitely felt like we were getting a good amount for the $35 price per person.","4","4/10/2019","139","mkt.","309 reviews","2108 N 55th St","American (New)","http://yelp.com/biz/mkt-seattle","4"
"363","139","I came to this spot to celebrate my brother's birthday and the experience did not disappoint! It is a tiny space, so i highly recommend making reservations. The service was fantastic, and they even left a little birthday card on the table before we came. For the size of the open kitchen being so small, the food came out decently quickly. We ordered the Sea Wolf Bakery Bread, Pan Seared Halibut, Grilled Black Peppercorn Wagyu Beef, campanelle, and the special of the day, duck breast. The portions were not huge but the quality was outstanding. I will comment that the duck & the wagyu was a bit undercooked, and this is coming from a person who likes his steaks rare, they were borderline blue. Sea Wolf Bakery Bread - Great stuff, came with honey rosemary fenel butterPan Seared Halibut - Perfectly seared on the outside (blackened but not burnt) with the fish being tender and debonedGrilled Black Peppercorn Wagyu Beef - Cooked a bit too rare (was not asked for how well done we wanted it) and even though the flavor was great, i couldnt tell it was wagyu.Campanelle - Fantastic pasta with a great light flavor& balance. The pasta was perfectly el dente, and you can tell that its handmade pasta, lots of good bounce to the dishDuck - the daily special was served over a bed of polenta and even though the duck was pretty rare, the flavor was exceptional.

"365","139","Dined here during Seattle Restaurant Week (SRW) and thought the whole experience was inbetween decent and good, but nothing special. For SRW, we got to share 5 appetizers for the table and pick our individual entree + dessert. *BurrataIt had soft and creamy texture, love it! The sweet apple went really well with the cheese. The only downside was the grilled crostini. They were hard as rock and too dry. *Tomato SoupServed in a shot glass. Bold and refreshing flavor!*Baby LettucesServed with red wine vinaigrette but honestly tasted just like any regular salad.*Beef TartareSubtly seasoned and you can smell the aromatic bone marrow aioli permeated the beef tartare. Yum! Shame that the grilled crostini pieces were burnt, hard, and dry just like those served with the burrata.*Grilled Green BeansOur favorite appetizer! While they were only seasoned with salt and lemon, they were surprisingly addicting! Also love the sweet and smoky aftertaste! We were also told that they were meant to be "finger food." Think of them as a healthier version of fries! *Grilled Coho SalmonThe salmon was mediocre and tasted like something you can whip up at home. The salsa verde was a good choice to enhance the flavor but I wasn't sure about the smoked turnip since it was quite bitter. *Pork Chuck LoinThe chuck loin was seasoned properly and that red wine sauce was good. The braised reddish vegetable (not sure what it was) added slight sweetness to the overall taste. Love it! *Pear ChiboustThe consistency resembles those of custards. The chiboust alone was remarkable but we both thought they put too much caramel sauce, making it a tad too sweet to enjoy. We could also taste cinnamon and ginger from the sauce which I wasn't a fan of. If you despise those two things, it might be something to watch for.Overall, some dishes were scrumptious and some were mediocre. The service was a bit spotty with one server was more attentive, friendlier, and less awkward than the other. Personally I wouldn't go back but this is one of those restaurants that you have to try at least once. Will be looking into other Ethan Stowell restaurants.","3","11/13/2018","139","mkt.","309 reviews","2108 N 55th St","American (New)","http://yelp.com/biz/mkt-seattle","4"

"369","139","Came here for dinner for the first time. It's a small restaurant with both indoor and outdoor seating. We sat on the community outdoor table, which was nice, but a little cramped. But if you're hungry, being cramped on a table with other people doesn't really phase you too much. We ordered the burrata to start and shared the corn and ricotta ravioli, as well as the wagyu beef with fingerling potatoes. The burrata was delicious and very refreshing with the mint. I'm not super huge on a lot of mint on my food, but this was very tasty! The corn ricotta ravioli was also very good. It came with six ravioli and lobster mushrooms. It was light, flavorful, and definitely something I would order again. The wagyu beef was alright. For $35, I was hoping that the meat wasn't going to be as overdone as it was and not have gristle. Having to saw at the gristle and sift through parts of my meat isn't very enjoyable. But the fingerling potatoes were cooked very well. It was a little too peppery for me, but that's just my personal preference with foods being a little too spicy. If you like some kick, you'd probably enjoy this dish. I would probably come back again to try more of their dishes and a repeat of their burrata!","5","8/6/2018","139","mkt.","309 reviews","2108 N 55th St","American (New)","http://yelp.com/biz/mkt-seattle","4"

"371","139","So this is one the Ethan Stowell restaurants. Honestly it reminds me, both in form and in menu, of How to Cook a Wolf. I don't necessarily mean that in a bad way, but the menu is very similar. I had their house Manhattan, which was everything that I like about Amaro in a glass. We ordered a variety of small and large plates - the cauliflower (which may have been my favorite thing), the burrata which was rich and creamy, the seawolf bread with honey fennel butter, the peppered wagyu, the salmon, and gnocchi which was outstanding and heavy handed on the sausage. I enjoyed this meal a bit morethan HTCAW, and would rather return here than there.","4","3/25/2019","139","mkt.","309 reviews","2108 N 55th St","American (New)","http://yelp.com/biz/mkt-seattle","4"
"372","139","Holy cow. This was 1000x better than I expected and I came in with high expectations. Came here during restaurant week on a double date. Made a reservation - definitely necessary because it's packed and a smaller interior. We got seats by the chef so we had a glimpse into the kitchen - front row seats to some yummy cooking! During restaurant week, we could choose two items each from the appetizer and main course section and a dessert. You're encouraged to dine family style and share. My partner and I decided to share one appetizer and three pastas. All of the options looked so good so it took us a while to make this decision. We ordered the English Pea and Mint Burrata - if you've been to one of Ethan Stowells restaurants you'll know the burrata is AMAZING. This was a seasonal combo- and delicious. I've never known English peas and mint to taste so good together. We ate every last bit up and even got extra crostini to finish it up. I would go back for this burrata.The first pasta we got was the Rigatoni w/ Pork Cheek and Snap Peas. Basically we saw pork cheek and knew we had to have it. This ended up being our favorite of the night. It's beautifully cooked, and snap peas are such a lovely addition. Per usual, the pork cheek was so soft and melts in your mouth. SO. GOOD. Would 100% come back for this, and I have a new found respect for snap peas in pasta.Next we got the Gnocchi with Pork Shoulder. I personally love all gnocchi's I've ever gotten at an Ethan Stowell so naturally I had to order this one. It didn't disappoint. Gnocchi were so light and pillowy. Our last pasta was the Paperdelle with Dungeness Crab. I didn't love this as much as I thought - maybe because it came out after the heavier dishes. It was a very light dish with a good serving of crab. I think next time I would definitely get the other pastas, and try something else instead of this (we were initially between this pasta and the truffle ravioli). We typically don't order dessert, but for restaurant week, it comes with your meal. We were pleasantly surprised and pleased with how thoughtful the desserts were here. We got the Seasonal Sorbet with Shortbread Cookie (Coconut and Lemon Sorbet) and the Chocolate Ganache Cake. The sorbet was delicious. Overall - awesome experience. I can't wait to come back and try more food here. This may be my new favorite of the ESRs, but I'll have to come back a few more times to really know ;-).","5","4/24/2018","139","mkt.","309 reviews","2108 N 55th St","American (New)","http://yelp.com/biz/mkt-seattle","4"
"373","139","Holy Guacamole!! MKT knocked my socks off!! It was so good! I was a bit worried because it seemed to have mixed reviews on yelp, but do not listen to them at all. This place is worth checking out. I had an incredible experience. It is the smallest restaurant I have ever seen in my entire life, so BE SURE TO MAKE A RESERVATION!!! I dropped in as a first-timer for Restaurant Week 2018 and... OMG!!! I was seriously so impressed by this place!! It was a fairly casual dining experience, my girl friend felt overdressed. The food was Fn AMAZING!! The service was so good!! Knowledgeable waitresses. This place is a must for SRW!! I swear they just kept bringing food out to us. I was stuffed when I left, almost in pain! LOL. Definitely going back to try more menu items. We both ordered the 3-course SRW. They brought out about 8 small courses prior to our entree. My thoughts:APPETIZERS:-Tomato soup shot - This was a tiny little portion, but it was a delicious treat! -Green beans in a cup - I don't know what they did to these beans, but they are by far the best green beans I have ever tasted, and I eat a lot of green beans. They were so well made! Crisp and citrusy! Try them! -Beef tartare - I love beef tartare, but honestly this was a bit bland. I think its the only thing we ate that didn't completely floor me. Portion size was good. I'd eat it again, but I did feel like it was missing something. -Roasted Beets - Also delicious! Hazelnut crumble and greens served with them.-Burrata - I had never tried burrata before so I was really excited for this and it definitely exceeded my expectations. Soft cheese served with fruit and spread over crustini. To die for!-Green Salad - It was typical. Also served citrusy. Basic. A little boring, but good for the gut. -I forgot the other 2 things she brought out. I mean the food just kept coming and coming! ENTREES:-Pork - This was really good! The sauce and crispy-whatever was on the top. Served with some type of pureed root vegetable. Holy Moly! Yumm! Tender. Juicy. Delicious.-Coho Salmon - This is a 10-star piece of fish! The skin was crispy and the salmon just fell apart when you stick your fork into it. It was the juiciest most delicious salmon I have ever eaten and I eat a ton of salmon. Damn! Sooo good! The sauce and sides too.DESSERT:-Berry Sorbet - I was so full I didn't even need this but of course i ate it anyway. It was juicy and refreshing. Really good. I couldn't even eat my cookie because I was so full of food. -Apple Al a mode - I didn't try this, but it looked really good. I'm definitely going back to MKT and trying other Ethan Stowell Restaurants! I highly recommend this place especially for SRW. I got the most value for my money here and everything was beautifully plated and just scrumptious. I ordered one glass of wine and the waitress brought me an extra half glass be cause she said she wanted to finish out the bottle. This experience was #winning!!!!!! I'd give it 10 stars if I could!!","5","11/16/2018","139","mkt.","309 reviews","2108 N 55th St","American (New)","http://yelp.com/biz/mkt-seattle","4"
"374","139","Went for Restaurant Week. I'm a meat lover, but I have to say that everything except the cooked meat was fantastic. My favorites were the burrata with apple, the beef tartare, the pumpkin raviolis and the strozzapeti. And special emphasis on those raviolis. I'm not a huge pumpkin fan, but those raviolis were amazing. But like I said, the cooked meats were unimpressive.

"375","139","It had been over four years since I last visited mkt. in Seattle's Tangletown neighborhood (4/5/18). Intrigued by the posted Seattle Restaurant Week (SRW) offerings, I called at 550pm for a solo reservation and got seated (=shoehorned in) at 620pm in between two couples at the front window counter.Three courses for $33, plus tax and automatic 20% gratuity added in, where there are 19 choices to select from for the starter and dinner entree. Great variety!I looked at their SRW menu online, so I was able to place my entire order pronto to the wait person. Unlike JuneBaby, where it is frequently condusive to strike up a conversation with total strangers. Definitely felt the notorious Seattle freeze here.Whatever, I'm anticipating the food, being warm (kept my coat on), and out of the squall I had just driven in. View, unfortunately, was of a telephone pole blocking Mr. Maximo's condo complex. No slouching here, as I kept being nudged or brushed upon with this teeny tiny space. Definitely not the place for sumo wrestlers to casually dine...besides that's better suited for Kisaku across the street, another Tangletown SRW favorite.No idle chit chat or lingering over a cocktail (stuck with water), I received my well paced courses in good time.First course was the fresh, creamy burrata with copious English peas and mint puree. Because of my recent dental mishap, I broke off pieces of crostini eating it very carefully. Definitely, the bright flavors epitomized spring on a plate. Seasonally sublime!Second course was totally spot on...ribbons of fresh al dente paparadelle with sliced asparagus, generous Dungeness crab, taken to the next level flavor wise with lemon and thyme. Made me think of my late dad, who prepared mass quantities of sweet, tender Dungeness crab when I was growing up. I liked checking the crab pots we'd hoist from the pier. My brother shared his Puget Sound catch a few years back...simply the best! We are blessed in the Pacific Northwest.Dessert had a simple presentation, but was packed full of flavor, the dense amaretto and ganache chocolate cake atop creme anglaise (or as the menu referred to as Madagascar vanilla bean custard). Excellent quality ingredients and preparation nailed the exclamation point to this evening's meal. Sure, I'd prefer dining with others for the company and conversation. But solo allows for absolute focus and unobtrusive service. Fantastic meal that uplifted my tired, borderline hangry demeanor. SRW at mkt. was outstanding and definitely highly recommended!","4","4/5/2018","139","mkt.","309 reviews","2108 N 55th St","American (New)","http://yelp.com/biz/mkt-seattle","4"

"377","140","Solid Americanized Chinese dishes. If you don't like your hot and sour sweet and cloying, ask for it sans sugar. Mongolian beef on tip. Fried rice with shrimp a plenty. The mao po tofu is also on the sweet side but made with the silkiest of tofu cubes. They lost a star on the oddly sweet dishes. Another because they included the tip in the final price then asked for additional tip separately. Will return for more of the menu as recommended by other Yelpers.","3","7/13/2019","140","Mei Mei Cafe","39 reviews","1004 NE 50th St","Chinese","http://yelp.com/biz/mei-mei-cafe-seattle-2","4"
"378","140","I came in as I was craving just some quick chinese food in the area and low and behold Mei Mei Cafe! There was no one inside, but was quickly greeted by the delightful woman behind the counter. Ordered spicy chicken lunch with hot & sour soup. It was nearly enough food for two meals all for around $10. Hot & Sour Soup - this was pretty decent. Not the best I've had but overall flavor was there. Nice to kick start the meal. Spicy Chicken - pretty darn tasty. Was a weird mix of general Tso's and sweet & sour sauce? Tasted a little sweet with a kick at the end. Not really spicy at all (I added sriracha) but it was good and cooked nicely. All in all a great stop for some quick eats. Their lunch specials are great and their dinner's aren't horribly priced either. I will certainly be back to try some other options!","4","5/8/2019","140","Mei Mei Cafe","39 reviews","1004 NE 50th St","Chinese","http://yelp.com/biz/mei-mei-cafe-seattle-2","4"
"379","140","This family run restaurant has very friendly service. The price point is amazing for the lunch specials and I asked for substitution that they were happy to oblige with.

"381","140","Got take out from here the other day for lunch. Their fried rice looks like my preferred style, so I have been wanting to try this place for awhile now. They do offer lunch specials (you can find these on their website), but I wanted leftovers so I ordered off the regular menu. I ordered pan fried dumplings,  chicken fried rice and general tsao's chicken. From the time I called, it took about 15 minutes for the food to be ready, perfect for my walk there. A few people were eating in and their food look delicious too. The lady was very kind at the counter and helped me get the to go order into a sturdier bag to walk back to my office. The portions are HUGE!!! The fried rice definitely hit the spot, the chicken in the rice was soo tender and delicious- I've never had better chicken in chicken fried rice (silly, but true). It also came with the peas and carrots, just how I like it. The General Tsao's was good, but a little too sweet for me. However the chicken was very good quality and still crispy when I got it back to work. I enjoyed the dumplings too, but would probably get crab rangoon next time. Anyways- if you're craving some Chinese take out, I definitely recommend this place!","4","2/17/2019","140","Mei Mei Cafe","39 reviews","1004 NE 50th St","Chinese","http://yelp.com/biz/mei-mei-cafe-seattle-2","4"
"382","140","The definition of a hidden gem!! Although tucked away a few blocks from university way, it is definitely worth the trip.I've tried the salt and pepper fish, xinjiang chicken (da pan ji), salt and pepper pork, and steamed chicken with chili oil sauce (kou shui ji). Everything is super delicious, especially the kou shui ji, which is the best I've had in Seattle so far. I also love their HK style milk tea, although I would recommend to take it with less sugar.My favourite part about this restaurant however is the service. The waitress/owner is the nicest I've ever met, giving us free things to try and guessing our needs before we even ask. The prices are great too, because the portions of the dishes are huuuge.

"385","140","To be clear, Mei Mei Cafe is not authentic Chinese food. But if you're single parenting all week long and need to feed your 15-month-old quickly, Mei Mei Cafe will serve up American Chinese food on the fly with a smile. I got take out and went with a classic--sesame chicken and a vegetable medley dish. I've had a hard time finding a place that does sesame chicken right in Seattle. Most of the time it's too bready, more General Tsao's chicken than sesame chicken. Mei Mei Cafe did it right. Their vegetable medley was also surprisingly flavorful. It was so good, in fact, that my son happily shoved fistfuls of veggies into his mouth. This will be our new go-to American Chinese takeout spot in the hood. You probably don't want to dine in. There's literally one table and it feels like it was put there as a second thought--like those tables at Domino's because they know no one is actually dining in.","5","8/25/2019","140","Mei Mei Cafe","39 reviews","1004 NE 50th St","Chinese","http://yelp.com/biz/mei-mei-cafe-seattle-2","4"

"389","140","Thank you, Yelpers! I would have missed this place completely. A TED talk*, of all things, made me crave American Chinese food. I look forward to trying more authentic dishes here in the future, but tonight I really wanted General Tsao's Chicken. We ordered that, the beef ho fun, and stir fried green beans. All were incredibly fresh and DELICIOUS. The couple running the place were lovely. We ate there - it's my kind of place. Low key and spotless. *The TED talk is called "The Search for General Tsao."

We went a couple minutes after the lunch special was over but the lady was so sweet and let us still do it. I got the chef's spicy chicken & my bf got the Mongolian beef. We both ordered the egg drop soup (which was a bit watered down). Honestly, you get what you paid for. This isn't a place where you go and sit down and have traditional Chinese food with your family. This is one of those Asian American restaurants where it's way better than Panda Express but still in the same genre.

"392","140","Value: 5+/5Service: 5/5 Food: 4.5/5Location / Access / Geo: 4/5TL;DR: Lunch specials are a tremendous value. Delicious food, modest $7.99 price. Friendly and helpful customer service, adding to my "Places in Seattle Where People Are Actually Nice to You" collection. We initially thought Mei Mei cafe was going to be some dirty, dingy, weird smelling Chinese restaurant but were extremely pleasantly surprised with our lunch. Value - Strong point here is their very modestly priced $7.99 lunch special. I've added this to my collection of "Seattle Lunch Specials", as I love to go out for delicious sub-$10 lunches around the Seattle area. She appreciates cash, but seems to accept credit cards above $4, which I thought was very reasonable. Food - Had Chef Spicy Chicken lunch special, and was very pleasantly surprised. Although I didn't try everything, and there were clearly very authentic chinese dishes, a lot of what we ate was surprisingly westernized and made to fit American taste preferences. Hot and Sour soup was a tad on sweet side but good.Service - Very friendly older woman (who I assume was the owner) saw my wife struggling to put her leftovers into her to go container (she was wearing our newborn baby in baby carrier) and she immediately volunteered to help. Such a sweet, nice lady! Really appreciated her and tipped her accordingly.Location - Grungy on the outside, but the parking lot has ample space. Due to Plaid Pantry closing next door, there always seems to be open parking spots, which is nice not to have to pay for parking in the u district. Interior is not fancy, but it is simple and clean (not a given at some chinese restaurants, of course). 3 tables that fit 4 people and some one-off seating is all there is though, it is a small but cozy space. I plan to be a regular here! Highly recommend.","5","4/18/2018","140","Mei Mei Cafe","39 reviews","1004 NE 50th St","Chinese","http://yelp.com/biz/mei-mei-cafe-seattle-2","4"

Been here twice in less that a week! Asked some of the locals about the place and apparently it's under new ownership.

In the end, we decided to order the Curry Hummus with Naan, Watermelon w/ Gorgonzola Cheese, Bulgogi Pincho, Jamon Pincho, Cured Salmon Pincho, and Tuna Tartare.Everything tasted delicious! I love cream cheese with my sushi so the Cured Salmon Pincho was my favorite Pincho that we ordered. The Jamon Pincho was my least favorite - it was a little salty and hard to eat since the meat wasn't easily torn. But my favorite dish by far was the Watermelon w/ Gorgonzola Cheese. When reading it, it seems odd to pair watermelon with gorgonzola cheese, crispy prosciutto, and mint...but it somehow works.We ended our dinner with the Warm Brownie dessert (that also came with ice cream).

Service: very friendlyFood: VERY good. We got picked out some pinchos (anchovy was the best), deviled eggs (get them, they were the best part of our meal), truffle steak (small in size but yummy), and the salmon tartar (really good but nothing special).

"402","141","When I hear Spanish/Asian fusion, my mouth immediately turns into a pursed straight line. Like, cool, I expect a mediocre/watered down version of both.But! I was very pleasantly surprised by this!My husband and I wanted to go for a late dinner somewhere near Greenlake and found this place on Yelp. Again, I was skeptical about the theme but the menu sounded interesting.Favorites:Drunken Mussels - This is a generous portion of mussels in a beautiful white wine broth with lots of garlic and a bit of welcome heat from red pepper flakes. I had never had mussels with thyme but I actually quite liked that addition too because it added a fresh herb element. Wish they served it with more bread!Pork belly & bulgogi buns - Loved the pickled daikon served on top which added both a crunch and a nice acidity to balance the sweet and fatty meats served inside the bun.Deviled eggs - I love deviled eggs! I was just telling my husband that I love ordering deviled eggs at tapas restaurants because it tends to be a flavor-packed bite. And we weren't wrong! I'm not sure how frequently they change this but when we went, it had candied bacon and some jalapeno (?) pepper. It was fantastic.Could use improvement:Ricotta meatballs - The marinara sauce was a little too acidic for my liking. It had that unmistakable canned tomato acidic flavor. There isn't anything wrong with canned tomatoes but I do wish it had a better flavor. Also, I loved how fluffy the meatballs were, but missed the browning on them.Cauliflower - Don't get me wrong. We annihilated this. But! It was charred with a torch and you can taste that. Wish it was pan-seared or oven broiled instead.Despite the two dishes that were kind of meh, I enjoyed my dinner here in part because of how kind their staff is and that you can sense the kitchen is very thoughtful about each dish they serve. The prices were also pretty reasonable for a tapas restaurant and they had a variety of dish sizes which was also nice. The food is probably a 4 star (for now) but the overall experience was a 5.","5","6/14/2019","141","Tapas Lab","132 reviews","7012 Woodlawn Ave NE","Tapas/Small Plates","http://yelp.com/biz/tapas-lab-seattle","4"
"403","141","The food is good, I just base my ratings depending on whether I would choose to return. My main issue was that I just didn't get even close to full, which is a deterrent to me considering the amount spent. Happy Hour Tuesday - Friday 4 - 6 PMSaturday - Sunday 3 - 6 PMBulgogi Bun $4 and Pork Belly Bun $4 - They each came in a cute individual steamer basket, so A+ for presentation. Bulgogi Pincho $2 HH ($3 Regular): For $2-3 this is a good deal, but I would find it repetitive to order enough of these to feel full. I wanted to try it with marinated potatoes instead of the bread, but I had to leave before it came out because my parking time ran out. Jamon Pincho $8 HH ($9 Regular): I just watched the episode of Brooklyn Nine-Nine where a $6,000 Jamon Iberico was a motive for murder, so as fate would have it I was able to try some for myself soon after! While tasty, for me spending $8 on such a small item hurt my cheap soul. Watermelon with Gorgonzola Cheese $5: All the flavors worked really well together. Honey Tiramisu $8: I didn't realize this at first, but you have to crush the honeycomb in there with your spoon to get some honey. Tiramisu usually tastes the same to me at most places, which isn't necessarily a bad thing since it's a solid dessert choice. *****My Star Ratings: 1 Star - Terrible. Just thinking about it makes me angry. 2 Stars - Meh. Unlikely for me to return. 3 Stars - OK. Open to coming back, but wouldn't go out of my way to. 4 Stars - Yummy!

The more fusion-y stuff was equally delicious and also quite creative. The lamb skewers come in these bottles of smoke - definitely a wow-factor but the meat was surprisingly tender and very well seasoned. Also, the salmon tartare is not to be missed!!!

We got spicy nuts, bulgogi and salmon pinchos, chicken skewers and meatballs. I loved pinchos the most. I would probably not order Meatballs again as they just tasted like regular meatballs while rest of the food we tried was pretty unique. Pinchos are messy to eat, tasty nonetheless. If the bread was thinner, it would be a lot easier to eat. I was also too full because the bread, and could not order more food. They offer $10 wine flight and $8 beer flight with some great selection for the price. Me and my husband both loved the reds we had. We were prepared for slow service based on other reviews, but that wasn't our experience at all! Our sever was very attentive, always refilled water glasses. The only thing is even though we ordered a lot of food together, dishes arrived as they were ready. I personally prefer that instead of waiting till everything's ready, and then having them at different temperatures. But it would have been good if server had set that expectation.

"408","141","What a Green Lake gem! Why is there not more fuss about such a nice place in the area.This place is pretty hidden and that might have something to do with it. You wouldn't necessarily think it's a restaurant when you're passing by. Our uber driver struggled to find it so we just hopped out and finally saw a very small sign.Once you've found the door and are inside though, it's very cute. Nice vibe and nice decor. It seems like a pretty versatile vibe. Good for a casual date night, or seeing friends but they also seem to have one big long table for groups.The name suggests the food will be Spanish but the menu seemed to have a lot of different influences. Some Spanish sure but also some asian (the chef is Korean) and some seafood and other bits and pieces.We ordered a caesar salad which was the most well presented caesar I've ever had. Very tasty too. Also ordered the spicy hummus (delicious), roasted cauliflower (great), salmon pincho (ok but not great) and steamed tofu bun (amazing and could have eaten all night).

"411","141","I'm generally not a fan of tapas, but I love Tapas Lab! Whenever someone proposes going for tapas, I don't get too excited; I always feel like there's not enough food to go around and its overpriced. However Tapas Lap is a different story. Generous portions for the quality of food you're getting at a very fair price. The first time I came here was for happy hour during the snowpocalypse so it was just my party and another group or two. We sat at the bar and ordered a handful of dishes: pinchos, mussels, meatballs, olives and dessert. Everything was delicious! My favorite pincho was definitely the shrimp one. My partner loved the mussels. Besides the food tasting good, all the dishes are beautifully prepared. It's fun to watch the chef assemble the different dishes--it's clear a lot of care goes into each plate. The second time we came here during regular hours on a Friday night and ordered some of the same dishes and their baos. Again, we were impressed. And, this time the restaurant was packed. I had read reviews that service was slow, but all the dishes came out quickly despite it being so busy. We generally don't venture out to Greenlake too often for dinner, but this place has been added to our list!","5","3/6/2019","141","Tapas Lab","132 reviews","7012 Woodlawn Ave NE","Tapas/Small Plates","http://yelp.com/biz/tapas-lab-seattle","4"
"412","141","Really great ambiance. A great space to grab a small bite to eat. This was my second time here and the food quality is consistently high. I only mark it down a star, because the staff was slow. We were seated right away, but after that things slowed down. We were near the counter and a handful of times our dishes just sat there before being brought to the table. We tried flagging a waiter down to order something extra, but even when 3 of them were behind the counter all of them ignored us. Eventually we were able to get someones attention and order something extra. The food was delicious and I'd definitely return to try some additional things. -Caesar salad: very beautifully presented. There was dressing at the bottom, but I think it needed a little more. -Salmon pincho: my favorite thing I had! The balsamic honey drizzle paired so well with the salmon. Really great mix of salty and a hint of sweet. -Bulgogi pincho: also really great. A little too salty but it came with a lot of meat -Muscles: perfectly salty. Didn't have too much seasoning (most of it was on outside of shell and didn't make it inside) -Anchovy pincho: I enjoyed this but the pepper was the most prominent flavor. Wish I got more fish taste.","4","5/4/2019","141","Tapas Lab","132 reviews","7012 Woodlawn Ave NE","Tapas/Small Plates","http://yelp.com/biz/tapas-lab-seattle","4"
"413","141","Went here on a weekday night around 8pm and the restaurant was completely empty, so we were able to get seated promptly. Many of their dishes here are for sharing, so we ordered a bunch of different tapas. We ordered the following: deviled eggs, curry hummus, chicken skewer, salmon pincho, bulgogi pincho, ricotta meatballs, and tuna tartare. Here's the breakdown of what I thought per item:-Deviled eggs:It costs $2 for 1 egg so kinda expensive. The deviled egg is very tasty and I liked the addition of candied bacon to add crispness. -Curry hummus with naan: I really enjoyed this dish. The naan was nice and warm and the hummus was very flavorful. -Chicken skewer: Not what I expected, it comes in a clear bottle with smoke in it. Slightly on the dry side, since all of the sauce was near the bottom of the bottle. -Salmon pincho: I enjoyed the smoked salmon, but probably would have preferred a smaller amount of cream cheese. -Bulgogi pincho: My favorite thing here! The bulgogi was very good and I loved the garlic aioli. -Ricotta meatballs: The meatballs were very filling and flavorful. It came with crostini that tasted good with the sauce. -Tuna tartare: This was my second favorite dish. The tuna was very fresh and this also tasted good with the crostini. Overall, I enjoyed coming here and would definitely come back here. It's a great place for enjoying a drink and tapas. The place itself is also very cute inside for a date night.","4","2/13/2019","141","Tapas Lab","132 reviews","7012 Woodlawn Ave NE","Tapas/Small Plates","http://yelp.com/biz/tapas-lab-seattle","4"

"415","141","I've been to Tapas Lab three times now, so you might think I like it.  Not so fast.  The food is good, and they have a nice selection of wines, plus the wine flights allow you to taste a variety of wines.  However, the service, which I had dismissed as just teething issues on my first visit, has not improved.First off, it's not obvious the place is open.  The front windows are darkened so you can't see in and they keep the door closed to keep the heat in.  Would to be too much to ask for an "open" sign?Secondly, service is slow.  Seriously, given the number of people who are generally dining, you would think they would have no issues with keeping up, yet they seem to disappoint.  Not a problem if you are in for a leisurely dinner, but a problem if you are using it for a drinks place before moving on.Sadly, and as a result, this will never be top of mind when it comes to a place to meet for drinks.  Go to Lucia or Shelter instead - they actually want to serve you.","3","2/15/2019","141","Tapas Lab","132 reviews","7012 Woodlawn Ave NE","Tapas/Small Plates","http://yelp.com/biz/tapas-lab-seattle","4"
"416","142","My boyfriend and I came here for date night and it has become our favorite "hidden gem" that turned into an anniversary tradition. We love pasta. Their restaurant is a small space and being that they're only open 5-11pm, I'd recommend going during the week. Their bread and dip appetizer is to die for! It's light and fluffy and appetizers set you in for the rest of the meal to come. My boyfriend got the Linquine con Gamberie and I got the Penne Pasta alla Vodka. Delicious, delicious, delicious. If you like everything with a bit of spice like myself, just ask for their sauce! Someone will come by and give you a teaspoon full of their secret sauce. Customer service is great. The intimate feel of the restaurant is amazing. It's a great place to dine!","5","11/12/2019","142","Pomodoro","437 reviews","2366 Eastlake Ave E","Italian","http://yelp.com/biz/pomodoro-seattle","4"
"417","142","Such a cute little spot! 11 of us went here for my husbands birthday. The ambiance is really cozy, would be perfect for a nice quiet date. The service definitely stands out. I love how they don't have many tables, the owner chats with every table. They are readily available for wine and food suggestions. They were very accommodating when some of our party was late. Because I reserved for a birthday they asked me my husbands name and sang a birthday song for him along with their complimentary tiramisu( very tasty!)The food is as good as the service if not better. We tried their Pomodoro con Aceto Balsamico, Pulpo a Feira (octopus) and Ravioli de Hummus y Trufa (hummus ravioli) as appetizers. The hummus ravioli was my least favorite but still good. Because I went with a large group I got to try a lot of their entrees. My favorite was the crab linguine and the gnocchi. The pasta was perfectly cooked, gnocchi was soft pillowy and the sauces were amazing. My linguine came with a lot of crab! The owner offered us his special habanero olive oil which a majority of my party tried and loved! He was very attentive and was very helpful with wine suggestions.Don't miss this place! It's not in at a very busy spot and they have free parking. The food, ambiance and service are on point!

"418","142","I was scrambling to find a place for dinner for 5 people on a Friday night, and luckily Pomodoro came the the rescue! It's a smaller restaurant that has a very intimate vibe with dim lighting and a partially open kitchen. To start we shared two tapas: the ravioli with hummus and truffle, and the calamari. Of the two, I preferred the calamari. The squid tasted fresh and it was sautéed squid rather than breaded and deep fried squid, which was a pleasant change. In comparison the ravioli was a bit too rich and heavy. For my entree I opted for the paella and I was happy with my choice! The amount of seafood was abundant and the presentation was pretty. I also enjoyed the seasonings and it was cooked well. The only suggestion I would have would be to get a bit more of a crispy layer in the skillet. The rice seemed like it was cooked into a larger batch and then served in the skillet they brought me, so I was missing the slightly crunchy and smoky bits I love in paella. After a while, the texture can be a bit one-note without them.","4","10/7/2019","142","Pomodoro","437 reviews","2366 Eastlake Ave E","Italian","http://yelp.com/biz/pomodoro-seattle","4"
"419","142","First of all, happy birthday to one of my best friend, Jordan!!!She's the reason why we discovered this restaurant since I never have a reason to be around this Eastlake neighborhood. The restaurant is super cute, small, and intimate, good thing we had a reservation. Food is great, my angel hair pasta just melts in my mouth. I ordered no shrimp because I don't eat seafood and they offered to replace it with mushrooms, wasn't even expecting a replacement. Everybody's food looked so good too, it was freshly made as you can see the hot steam coming in the air while everybody is eating. Service was excellent considering we did came in a large group. They even came outside to take a group photo for us which you already know, it's time consuming when it's all girls xDThere's unlimited bread as appetizers, be careful or you might actually get too full before your entree comes out. Love this place, nice enough for date nights/special occasions and cozy enough if you casually just want some good Italian food for dinner. I hate cooking, good thing I didn't have to last night.Tell me about your experience if you've been here or is going to after reading this review:)","5","9/21/2019","142","Pomodoro","437 reviews","2366 Eastlake Ave E","Italian","http://yelp.com/biz/pomodoro-seattle","4"
"420","142","I've been here two times already and both times have been amazing! They have free parking behind the restaurant and can make? reservations online for big parties in advance.Both times I ordered the Linguine alla Carbonara con Pancetta, which has pork belly and ?light cream. It was very delicious and satisfying to my stomach! Normally I feel so bloated after eating pasta but I ate the whole damn thing! I also had a malbec (red wine) to complement my pasta. There's also a bread appetizer served with some cilantro butter, so yummy!Last night I came here for my birthday dinner and the staff brought out a tiramisu cake with a candle. The cake was rich in coffee flavor. The staff was also patient with our large party and even split up our checks and took a picture for us!I love coming here and would love to try new things on their menu when I have another chance.

"421","142","Came here for a friend's birthday and had a great meal! The restaurant is in a quiet area of Eastlake and is pretty low key. The chef walks around and takes your order and provides some great recommendations. We ordered the portobello mushrooms and octopus as appetizers. Both were delicious! They also bring you bread that comes with a side of pesto - love when Italian restaurants give pesto instead of bread or olive oil! For the entrees, we ordered the Gnocchi con Salsiccia e Funghi, paella, and Capellini al Aglio con Polpa di Grancio e Tartufo. The paella was really good and came with a good variety of seafood (calamari, mussels, shrimp) and wasn't overly greasy. The capellini was delicious! I loved the crab meat and truffle oil. The gnocchi was good as well, but my least favorite out of the 3. Additionally we tried their tiramisu and it was amazing!

"424","142","My dining experience at Pomodoro was as a part of a large-party. For those interested in making a large party reservation, they will typically require you to book a time earlier than their normal dinner hours and charge a late/overtime fee if your group shows up late or stays beyond the allocated time. The service was very friendly throughout the evening and as they were prepared for our party, servers were very prompt as well. They quickly took everyone's individual pasta orders as they sat down and served the caesar salad shortly after. The dressing on the caesar was very flavorful and was not too salty or heavy. It did seem like the lettuce had been sitting in the dressing for a while though-- this might not be an issue with a regular dining experience.  I ordered the Penne alla Vodka, which I believe was the best dish out of the pre-selected options we were given. It was the perfect balance between creamy and tangy. There could've been a bit more sausage or veggies to mix up the texture though. I also had a bite of the Sun Dried Tomato Pesto con Linguine pasta, which was alright, but felt like it was missing a certain 'oomph'. Perhaps some extra spice or citrus (lemon squeeze?) would really brighten it up. The prawns served with the dish were very plump and fresh though! The tiramisu was average-- we did notice that each piece seemed to have a different flavor profile (more chocolatey, more alcoholic, more coffee) so there was a lack of consistency but the taste was fine.","4","5/28/2019","142","Pomodoro","437 reviews","2366 Eastlake Ave E","Italian","http://yelp.com/biz/pomodoro-seattle","4"
"425","142","Love this place. Perfect little neighborhood Italian restaurant. Ideal for date nights, celebrating, or if you're just craving some delicious Italian food. Romantic, intimate, and homey vibe. Portion sizes are generous and food is always consistently delicious. I love their caesar salad. I always get the same entree, the chicken breast with gorgonzola sauce and pasta with red sauce. It's absolutely amazing! Chicken is tender and juicy. I always have a hard time deciding if I want a creamy white sauce or a zesty tomato sauce and I love this dish because I get the best of both worlds. The chicken is covered in a creamy gorgonzola and the pasta is in a light tomato sauce. Portion size is very generous. They also have a house made chili oil that you can ask for on your pasta. It's too spicy for me, but if you love some heat I recommend. I have also ordered the carbonara, which I recommend. I also highly recommend the tiramisu.  Definitely one of my favorite Italian restaurants in the city! There is also a free covered parking garage that is super convenient.","5","7/26/2019","142","Pomodoro","437 reviews","2366 Eastlake Ave E","Italian","http://yelp.com/biz/pomodoro-seattle","4"
"426","142","I am giving this restaurant five stars despite a couple of unsettling experiences with our waiter. The food is just that good.My husband took me out to dinner at Pomodoro last night to celebrate my birthday. It is a lovely little restaurant, with creative lighting (red circle lights, tiny twinkling white lights, and warm yellowish-white lights), and crisp white tablecloths.I had the tomato cream soup, the paella, and I split the dungeness crab linguine with my husband. My husband also had the pork pancetta. My husband is characteristially very unenthusiastic, so when I asked him how his food was and he said "good" (he says "okay" 95%+ of the time that I ask him this question), I knew that the food was an unusually special experience for him, too! My food was absolutely outstanding, probably among the top ten meals I've ever eaten. The chef had a lovely long blurb included in the menu about his love for cooking, a few of his famous customers, and his experience as a chef. While I enjoyed reading this blurb, I definitely judged the food on my actual experience of eating it, which was heavenly.We also ordered a bottle of the Cava Mont Marcal wine. I enthusiastically recommend this wine. It was outstanding.Our waiter has a very genteel manner, but his memory and attentiveness are unfortunately severely lacking. We arrived fairly late, just after 9pm, and perhaps he'd had a long and busy night before we arrived. He also appeared to be pushing 90 years old.He smiled a lot and he seemed like he was trying his best, but he basically ignored us for the middle half of our meal. My husband had to literally get up out of his chair three times to go up to him when we needed something. He was just in his own world (also I think partially closing the restaurant, but we just couldn't get his attention for several minutes on end after several tries). He was respectful and sweet when he did get to us, however, he also brought up four very serious and upsetting topics (communism, genocide, global warming, and immigration), all of which I deeply care about, however, I would prefer very much to focus on lighter, more pleasant conversational topics while eating a celebratory birthday dinner. It was an odd experience - I must say I've actually never had a waiter bring up such topics when dining out.At the start of our meal, I informed the waiter that I am gluten-free due to a serious medical condition which gluten can aggravate terribly. I was happy to see that there are gluten-free options for many of the dishes, which I requested. He seemed to really listen to that, which is important to me, and I did not flare with my condition after eating my meal.However, at the end of the night, he brought me out a surprise piece of tiramisu with a flaming birthday candle on it. He had a huge smile on his face and he looked so excited, and I was delighted! However, when he put the piece of tiramisu in front of me I had a scared feeling for a second and asked him, "Is this gluten-free?" He said, "No." I said, "I can't eat it then, can you please take it away?" He said, "I'm sorry, I didn't know." I said, "Yes, you did know, because I told you at the beginning of the meal that I am gluten-free due to a serious medical condition." He said again, "I'm sorry, I didn't know." To be honest, the apology seemed genuine. He seems like a nice person. But it's a little scary that he completely forgot something that could have caused me serious pain.But then he said, "well, your husband can eat it then." I said, "My husband will not be eating birthday cake in front of me on my birthday that I am not able to eat." He offered me Spumoni or coffee on the house. I declined.I feel like he was really trying to make things right, I think he just wasn't getting it. I got upset and asked my husband to pay for our meals and asked my husband to leave a 20% tip to be polite (I usually tip between 23% - 27%). I left the restaurant and waited for my husband in the car while he paid. I feel like the waiter does embody the spirit of service that I look for when I dine out, despite t","5","7/10/2019","142","Pomodoro","437 reviews","2366 Eastlake Ave E","Italian","http://yelp.com/biz/pomodoro-seattle","4"

"428","142","Oh I really don't know about this one. Love the story behind it, but the food didn't sell me. Menu was large and so were the entree portions. I ordered olives to start to have with their bread (which tasted like it was from Fred Meyer) and the olives were just okay. Too much raw garlic and the olives were pitted, but soggy and too tender. Maybe people like olives this way and I'm just not aware of it? I want to add that I work in a high end Spanish tapas bar myself, so I am a bit critical. The butter with the bread was nice, but I don't eat dairy, so just a taste for me. The pasta portions were massive, easily for 2-3 people to share, so the 20+ dollar price tag wasn't nearly as shocking. My pasta was cooked well, and one of the only options that could be done without dairy. If you're vegan, I'm not sure what you would be able to eat here and feel fulfilled with the price tag. Wine selection was disappointing. Staff was friendly and attentive. Also, paella is not "risotto."","3","10/28/2019","142","Pomodoro","437 reviews","2366 Eastlake Ave E","Italian","http://yelp.com/biz/pomodoro-seattle","4"
"429","142","I came to Pomodoro the night after an interview to reward myself and unwind a bit. I ordered the Dungeness crab angel hair pasta special and loved it. Though it was pricey, there was a good amount of crab. I believe it also had some black truffles which added great flavor to the simple butter garlic sauce. They also offer a spicy sauce to drizzle on top and I would highly recommend it. It is a bit spicy so maybe ask to try a little on the side first. For dessert I got the creme brûlée. This is perhaps one of my favorite dessert dishes so I couldn't resist. I was somewhat disappointed. Instead of the creamy center it usually has, this one was much firmer. The flavor was good but the texture was certainly off. The top tasted like a toasted marshmallow which, again, is not quite what one typically looks for in a creme brûlée. But it was good and I ate it up. However for $9 it is definitely not worth the price. Service here is really good. The owner is very friendly and chatted to me a little about my trip to Seattle. Other employees were very efficient and friendly as well. The check did feel a little rushed at the end but otherwise the service was great!If you're looking for somewhere to go for a special occasion this would be a really good option. The food is a little pricier but it is delicious. The ambiance creates a more upscale feel and the service is on point.","5","1/14/2019","142","Pomodoro","437 reviews","2366 Eastlake Ave E","Italian","http://yelp.com/biz/pomodoro-seattle","4"

We ordered vodka sauce on one order and their roasted red pepper sauce on the other. The sauces were delish but they used glass noodles. It did not taste right. Glass noodles are for Asian dishes.

We also got the Veal Pasta which was also good, but our favorite was the crab pasta.For Dessert, the Tiramisu is by far the best.  It just melts in your mouth and is very cold.  It is like eating a chocolate Mousse and is covered in chocolate powder.  A perfect end to a perfect meal.","5","3/11/2019","142","Pomodoro","437 reviews","2366 Eastlake Ave E","Italian","http://yelp.com/biz/pomodoro-seattle","4"

This place is a must try for any adventurous eaters, the servers are very enthusiastic. Honestly, I don't remember the last time I walked into a Chinese restaurant with an impeccable service (Just wave if you need extra attention, they will come to you right away)The Sauerkraut Fish is their signature main dish, it is a great combo of spicy, sour, savory, and numbing flavors altogether. We ordered the small size (1-2people) with 5 side dishes and that was sufficient for us two (we do eat A LOT).Zoe and I would highly recommend this place to anyone interested in trying new restaurants in the Seattle area.

"438","143","Came here with a couple of friends because it was newly opened and I'm always excited and curious to try new Chinese restaurants, as they're starting to diversify in what they serve. To see a restaurant open nearby that specializes in suancai yu, the restaurant's namesake, really intrigued me!Immediately when you walk in, you notice that this place has a really nicely themed decor. The wallpapers are all well-designed around the idea of their fish. One wall has a giant 9-panel TV that is playing a documentary about where they source their fish. While it may feel a bit out of place, I can't deny it was kinda cute. The way this restaurant is designed definitely reminds me of a newer restaurant that might open up in China, which I really appreciated.Upon being seated, all of the staff there yells "????", or "Welcome". This may be a bit off-putting at first, and some people might find it uncomfortable, but I honestly found it incredibly endearing! When they bring the food out, the staff also yells "??", or "Food has arrived", which was just another one of those cute and endearing things.Moving onto the food, we ordered their specialty suancai yu in the small size, and two orders of hongtang ciba, deep-fried rice cake with red sugar syrup. The food came out pretty quickly, and the first thing I want to say about the fish is that despite the small size being recommended for 1-2 people, I felt like it was plenty for the party of three that I came with. The fish is undeniably fresh. The flavor is definitely there; the broth and pickled vegetables definitely do not overpower the fishiness. That being said, there was no real funk to the fish, which made it all the more enjoyable. The fish was sliced into small pieces, and it was thoroughly deboned, meaning that it was very easy to eat the fish, and there wasn't much of a hassle. What I really appreciated, however, was the fact that the broth was just the right strength of flavor. This kind of dish can definitely lean towards the saltier side at many other places, but I think that their aware that the fish and pickled vegetables already give the broth enough of that salty flavor, and so there wasn't much of a need to make it anymore salty. The fish also had a good amount of spice, but nothing that was too much to handle. But with that being said, I can handle spice pretty well, so I may not be very qualified to speak on that aspect.I don't have much to say about the deep-fried rice cake. It was very crispy and crunchy on the outside, the fry was really nice, and the inside was chewy and very mochi-esque. The flavor of the syrup takes a bit of time to really hit. At first, it might just taste like breakfast syrup, but the flavor of the red sugar comes through after a few seconds. Overall, it's a really good way to balance out the sourness and saltiness of the fish!Overall, this place is quite an enjoyable experience. The service here was really nice and attentive, though it definitely helps if you speak Chinese here. Do I think it's a bit overpriced? Yeah, maybe a bit, but I think that the flavor helps me to look past it. I'm super happy to see that there are new, fresh Chinese restaurants opening up in University District, and will definitely come back here to try new things out!","4","9/2/2019","143","Buerjia Chinese Sauerkraut Fish","23 reviews","4509 University Way NE","Chinese","http://yelp.com/biz/buerjia-chinese-sauerkraut-fish-seattle-2","4"
"439","143","I've heard this place is good but a little bit expansive before I came, but now I totally understand why that is the case. Unlike most of the place that serve sauerkraut fish, the fish they use at this restaurant is extremely fresh. They have a big projection screen displaying videos that introduce where their fish come from and how they prepare the dish. Two of us ordered a small sauerkraut fish with a side of wild starch noodles and rice. Like most of my friends who came here before, we didn't finish it because the plate was just HUGE. I thought the add-ons are expensive at first but I think it's worth it after seeing how much they actually give you for the price. Our fish was served pretty fast and we were satisfied in general. The service was really nice - our servant introduce their signatures to us, constantly checked how we felt while we were eating and helped us pack the leftover in the end. It's also funny to hear all the staff shout out their slogan once for a while. They start to become busy after 6pm, so come here early if you don't want to wait. As for the price, we spend $50ish in total and I do think it's a little bit pricy even though their quality is good. I'm not sure if I will come back regularly but you should check this place out at least once if you are interested!","4","8/9/2019","143","Buerjia Chinese Sauerkraut Fish","23 reviews","4509 University Way NE","Chinese","http://yelp.com/biz/buerjia-chinese-sauerkraut-fish-seattle-2","4"

This location at UW is brand new and is more spacious in terms of both dining area and waiting area!The fish tastes good but I have to say that the taste of starch is easily sensed, whereas that taste barely exist in all my previous experience at the Bellevue location.

We had the largest size of the sauerkraut fish, and it was really really really huge! The sliced fish was tender and fresh, but be aware of the fish bones. We added lotus roots and mushrooms to it, and they tasted great. We also tried the century eggs, which were authentic. The cauliflowers were disappointing, being simply steamed and tasted plain.

The additional toppings made the dish a notch better, however I do hope that they eventually offer more choices for toppings such as pigs blood. The soup was savory and I enjoyed slurping down the broth with each bite of the noodle. The service was impeccable for a Chinese restaurant. They constantly came to ask us if we needed anything else and to refill our glasses. I worry that their voices may get hoarse because they yell welcome to all who come in and when the food arrives.

"445","143","This restaurant replaced Caliburger on the Ave and is a welcome new addition to the rapidly expanding Chinese cuisine options in the University District.FOOD:The main dish served here is their signature Saurkraut Fish (more accurately, Chinese pickled vegetable fish). It's unlike anything I've ever tasted (in a good way). The numbing spicy flavor infused with the sourness of the pickled vegetables creates a complex flavor that complements the fish very well. However, its level of spiciness is not for the faint of heart - and there's unfortunately no way to adjust the spiciness. If you have seafood allergies, this is not the place for you, as this fish is the only main entree they serve. We added enoki mushrooms and clear noodles to the fish, which were a nice addition. We also ordered their chicken wings (probably the best of these three), pickled cucumber, and sticky rice cakes as appetizers, none of which were too standout. PRICE:This place is quite expensive, with a medium serving size of the fish costing $50, quoted for 2-3 people. Not somewhere that I would go very often.SERVICE:Service was outstanding. Although the place just opened, staff seemed to have the workflow down very smoothly. We were checked in on often by multiple people, and water was refilled at least four times without being asked. ENVIRONMENT:The restaurant interior is quite nice, with a large TV display combination advertising the restaurant and where the fish comes from. OVERALL:The main dish was great, although will be perceived as quite spicy for some and a bit too pricey to be eating too often. Definitely a place to try at least once and I can see it doing very well on the Ave in the years to come.","4","8/4/2019","143","Buerjia Chinese Sauerkraut Fish","23 reviews","4509 University Way NE","Chinese","http://yelp.com/biz/buerjia-chinese-sauerkraut-fish-seattle-2","4"

"457","144","Ugly Mug cafe is an unsuspecting cafe squeezed between some construction sites, so you could easily miss it if you weren't looking for it. That being said, the inside is warm, cozy, and the perfect place to study during the Seattle fall! The menu has multiple specials (such as Earl Grey milk teas, pumpkin lattes, and Mexican mocha to name a few) as well as unique desserts such as tiramisu cake and Belgian waffles. I went there to escape the cold with a friend, and Ugly Cafe provided much needed shelter (and warm drinks!). I got the hot cocoa and the tiramisu cake and the total was about $12, so a bit on the pricier end. That being said, the tiramisu was soooo creamy and had the perfect amount of coffee. The hot cocoa was provided in a large steaming mug. The table we sat at contained letters and scraps of poetry, which added to the homey ambiance of the cafe. There is free wifi, so students flock to this cafe. I was lucky to find a table to sit at, but I can imagine that if you came at peak hours you would be pressed to find a seat to sit at! Despite the prices, I definitely think Ugly Mug cafe is worth checking out if you're craving some unique desserts paired with warm drinks.","4","11/2/2019","144","Ugly Mug Café","450 reviews","1309 NE 43rd St","Breakfast & Brunch","http://yelp.com/biz/ugly-mug-caf%C3%A9-seattle-6","4"

I'm no stranger to pricey drinks as my go-to order is a bit elaborate with multiple upcharges, but I was still surprised by my total here ($8 after tip for a latte compared to ~$6 elsewhere). It won't stop me from coming back in the future, but it will make this a less frequented spot for me, even though I already do coffee as a "treat" as it is. They do have some sort of rewards program, for what that's worth, but so do most shops.Also, it's crowded/cramped. Pretty typical of places in this neighborhood, but wouldn't be a go-to place for me to study/meet/hang out. I grabbed coffee to go both times, once in the afternoon and once in the morning, and both times felt a bit claustrophobic and eager to be on my way.The coffee is REALLY good, though.

"470","144","Some visit are better than others which is why I decided to give a rating of three stars... To begin with there's construction going on outside, which makes the overall experience of just getting in hectic! And if you come during lunch time... good luck. There's not much seating considering it is a small Café! Majority of the staff are college students, who don't necessarily make you feel welcome when you come...sadly. However, as of the quality of the beverages and food... you can never go wrong with any drink purchased whether it be an americano, green tea lattes, white mocha, or the occasional lavender ice tea (one of my favs)!! Hot beverages often come with a small design which is always nice! However for the food it honestly depends on the time of a day.. if you come when it's busy your food will probably be cold but in the early mornings or afternoon it's almost always perfect! I recommend the Belgium waffles, grilled cheese, and the California BLT!P.s. one of my favorite things about this cafe is the tables and how people are able to leave notes beneath the glass!

"475","144","Tip: Reduce sugar level in your drinks or ask for the syrup on the side (for belgium waffle) !I came here with my friend for a quick breakfast/coffee run while we were in the area waiting for another friend. With a bunch of other coffee shops in the area, this is a cute coffee shop that is most likely a Korean coffee shop as there were a couple of march with Korean characters. The overall coffee shop also had a more Asian coffee shop feel, which is good thing! There are a decent amount of seating in the cafe, but with it located in a university town, expect lots of students studying in the cafe. However, most of them are nice enough to let you share tables with them, so just ask! They had a decent amount of selections, with standard coffee items like latte and also more unique items like the earl grey latte. My friends and I ended up getting a matcha latte and an earl grey latte for drinks and a Belgium waffle to share. Overall I think the drinks and food were great, except for one small thing - there's a bit too much sugar. While I had no issues with my hot matcha latte, my friend's earl grey latte probably had way too much syrup. We both felt like we would get sugar high off of it. Same thing with the Belgium waffle, while it looked amazing, there were way too much syrup drizzled over it for my liking. I felt like my waffle was getting drenched in the syrup on top of also having powder sugar already on it. Despite having way too much sugar, I still like the feel of the cafe, and would definitely still recommend it. I would just recommend people ask for less syrup when they order certain items unless you are someone who really likes to have a lot of sugar/syrup.","4","6/8/2018","144","Ugly Mug Café","450 reviews","1309 NE 43rd St","Breakfast & Brunch","http://yelp.com/biz/ugly-mug-caf%C3%A9-seattle-6","4"

Most of the tables are small and only accommodating for 2 people. They were out of basically every kind of pastry when we arrived at 1pm on a Sunday, so it seemed like half the menu was off limits.I ordered an americano with their pumpkin syrup and the cream curdled when I poured it in (which the barista wasn't surprised about when I told her - apparently that's how it reacts to the acidity of the pumpkin), so they made me a new one and added non-dairy milk. My friend who also got a pumpkin latte agreed with me that there was ZERO flavor of pumpkin or spices at all. It just tasted like coffee. The yogurt I got was just ok. Nothing to write home about. I wouldn't come back.","2","10/25/2019","145","Mr West Cafe Bar","56 reviews","2685 NE Village Ln","Wine Bars","http://yelp.com/biz/mr-west-cafe-bar-seattle-4","4"
"478","145","Cute new addition to University Village! I love the Mr West Cafe Bar downtown, so I had a good feeling about this. I stopped in with my hubby for happy hour and a quick bite. He got an Old-Fashioned and I got a glass of Rose. The interior of the cafe/bar is adorable and there is tons of seating. We opted to sit outside as it was a lovely sunny day. Their selection of cocktails and beers is great! For food, we got the foccacia & prosciutto board, and the cheese board off the HH menu. The foccacia board was out of this world. The bread was lightly toasted, crunchy, and soft at the same time. It came with whipped ricotta, which was amazing & the prosciutto tied it all together! All of this for $11, a good price point for how much you get!I was honestly less impressed with the cheese board, as it showcased 3 cheeses hand selected by the in-house cheesemonger, which were admittedly delicious, but so sparse, so for $10 I didn't think it was a bargain at all. Overall- loved my first experience at this location and our server was great too! I'll definitely be back soon!","4","10/24/2019","145","Mr West Cafe Bar","56 reviews","2685 NE Village Ln","Wine Bars","http://yelp.com/biz/mr-west-cafe-bar-seattle-4","4"
"479","145","I've been dying to come here ever since I saw the sign back in May that they're opening an establishment in U Village. It beats the craziness to go down to downtown -- I wouldn't have minded going into downtown since it is the original, but, it did make me happy that they were opening up another one :) My sister and I went and honestly, the food is superb. Their salads are colorful and full of ingredients that it's worth the buck I'd say. I mean, let's be honest, it may be a bit pricey but the keywords here are: aesthetically pleasing. You'd want to get pics LOL. I'd say to get the smoked salmon toast. My sister got this and I believe their salmon is wild because of the deep color. It's very tasty. We shared the Meeze platter composed of a red beet hummus and red pepper tzatziki. Both came with tandoori bread and fresh veggies. It was certainly different but good! I had a handsome salad and it was pretty filling.A couple of cons: I would say that the service could've been better. The waitress we had only would come from time to time but would present that she may not have wanted to be there. There was two other staff that would assist as well. In addition, there were fruit flies... My sister and I had to shoo them from the drinks we had. There were a few that came in and we were evidently suspicious of where it was coming from. It wasn't a big deal but we wouldn't want to have flies coming in and out while we are eating :P Maybe because we were close to the patio...we'd prob pick a different spot next time. Overall the cafe is white, very nice with plants in one area and selling of some accessories such as little trinkets, plants, candles etc.","4","10/19/2019","145","Mr West Cafe Bar","56 reviews","2685 NE Village Ln","Wine Bars","http://yelp.com/biz/mr-west-cafe-bar-seattle-4","4"
"480","145","Mr. West = Mr. Fabulous! So glad they opened this place inside U Village. It's clean and modern Decour compliments the beautiful plant life on display. The menu is not vast but they have plenty of small plates or shared plates to choose from. They have happy hour from 4 PM to 7 PM Monday through Friday. They also have a good wine menu to choose from along with beer and other drinks. The staff is great and there is plenty of seating both indoor and outdoor. If alcohol doesn't tickle your fancy they also have wonderful non-alcoholic and espresso drinks.Overall I will definitely be back. It is a great stop along the way while you are shopping.","4","9/21/2019","145","Mr West Cafe Bar","56 reviews","2685 NE Village Ln","Wine Bars","http://yelp.com/biz/mr-west-cafe-bar-seattle-4","4"
"481","145","Thrilled that there's a Mr. West in the U-Village shopping center! It's much easier to access than the downtown Seattle location and has free parking as well as other convenient shops nearby while we're in the area anyway.Service was fantastic. They have very friendly staff who are also very chill. The space is much smaller than the flagship location but still a good amount of seating--indoor and outdoor. Downside is that if the line gets long, it goes out the door (might be rough during the colder season).We got the seasonal shrub and soda! Both very tasty. I could have used a little less syrup in my shrub though--felt very sweet (and overall too strong of a flavor). Delicious nonetheless.The cashier asked a courtesy question "have you had shrubs before?" Which I have had before (and I love the vinegar-y taste) but I really appreciated that she took the extra step to make sure that I was getting something that would be good for me. Thoughtful!","5","10/12/2019","145","Mr West Cafe Bar","56 reviews","2685 NE Village Ln","Wine Bars","http://yelp.com/biz/mr-west-cafe-bar-seattle-4","4"
"482","145","What an amazing additional member to the shopping plaza! Finally a place where you can sit down, sips some coffee after your shopping trip! Really love the storefront which looks amazing. Both doors have seating area outside so the whole place has plenty of seats. I just love how the interior looks so elegant and fancy. 100% recommend if you want to snap some insta-worthy photos! We got some coffee which is the egg cream one which was okay, 3/5 because I didn't really enjoy it that much. They have a full bar with cocktails, red and white wines if alcohol is what you're looking for.The price is a bit higher than coffee shops around them but it's pretty reasonable.","4","9/21/2019","145","Mr West Cafe Bar","56 reviews","2685 NE Village Ln","Wine Bars","http://yelp.com/biz/mr-west-cafe-bar-seattle-4","4"
"483","145","A solid 3 stars for me. Food was pretty good but service could have been better.I came to meet a few friends for happy hour after work. We were seated right away and got a nice table on the patio. We barely made happy hour so we were able to order one drink each from the menu. I had the rosé, which was decent. To eat we decided to share some different things among us, because this isn't really a "restaurant" with large plates. We had the Summer Corn Salad, the Brussels Sprout Caesar Salad and the Summer Burrata. Between the 4 of us, this was actually pretty filling, because the portion sizes are decent (at least for the salads). And everything was delicious - my favorite was the Brussel Sprout Salad for sure.Our service, however, was really poor - our server took 10-15 minutes (sometimes longer) at a time to take our orders, check on us, and bring out drinks. Then, the check took nearly 15 minutes as well after we asked for it, and it wasn't really busy. I would come back but probably for a cup of coffee and a light bite, not for a hang out or happy hour.","3","10/7/2019","145","Mr West Cafe Bar","56 reviews","2685 NE Village Ln","Wine Bars","http://yelp.com/biz/mr-west-cafe-bar-seattle-4","4"
"484","145","This is your typical cafe with clean aesthetic vibes. One thing to note is that the tables were kinda close to each other so you can't really have private conversations.Cafe looked super inviting and the food looked soooo promising but was ultimately disappointing. I got the salmon toast and the salmon had a strange red-food-coloring look to it. It also tasted kinda rubbery. The toast was dry and difficult to cut at times (the crust was impossible).The grilled cheese wasn't bad when it was warm but as it cooled it got harder and harder to cut until it was basically rock solid. The cheese part didn't have much depth to it. The toast had burnt areas and the cooled-down cheese had the consistency of a cracker. The matcha soda was meh, maybe it just wasn't for me but I thought the lemon flavor was too strong.","3","8/8/2019","145","Mr West Cafe Bar","56 reviews","2685 NE Village Ln","Wine Bars","http://yelp.com/biz/mr-west-cafe-bar-seattle-4","4"
"485","145","Fun spot and definitely a place the Village needed-what a great addition. Beautiful ambience and décor and the open space concept with counter top is very inviting. After ordering, you'll take a seat and they will bring your food to you; only downside is, if you want to add something to your order, you're going to have to get back in that line (which can be loooooong sometimes).Sandwiches we got were average and I will come back to try their other items. We came here for lunch on a weekday and they ran out of their egg sandwiches-I assume the morning crowd got to enjoy the goods.","5","8/12/2019","145","Mr West Cafe Bar","56 reviews","2685 NE Village Ln","Wine Bars","http://yelp.com/biz/mr-west-cafe-bar-seattle-4","4"

"487","145","Food- 4/5 Service- 4/5Price- 3.5/5 This place screams my aesthetic! One of my favorite cafes to study or to have brunch at. We went for a caramel latte (extra caramel) w/oat milk, avocado toast, and BLT toast. I wasn't the biggest fan of their caramel latte- mostly because it lacked the caramel flavor even with the "extra caramel". The barista was very understanding and let me switch my drink! (got my usual, a matcha latte w/oat milk)Avocado toast- basic but this toast is one of my favorites! They give a generous amount of avocado and the curry flavor added is so unique!

Consistency and presentation was nice. The aged cheddar toast with honey and sea salt would have been delicious but the crust, which made up a lot of the toast, was rock solid- not nearly as hard as my grilled cheese though. We added bacon and avocado to the grilled cheese which would have been amazing but again, the bread was so hard that I thought I was going to break my teeth and my husband literally thought he chipped his molar. Super bummed, all of the food was presented beautifully but hopefully they can overcome the bread situation.","3","9/20/2019","145","Mr West Cafe Bar","56 reviews","2685 NE Village Ln","Wine Bars","http://yelp.com/biz/mr-west-cafe-bar-seattle-4","4"
"489","145","Another cafe in University Village?! I know, my thoughts exactly. But as someone who frequents UVillage, I was eager to see if the addition of Mr West was a correct choice. Thursday afternoon was surprisingly busy with a line at the door and seating almost at full capacity. But beyond the doors was a large outdoor seating area in addition to all the seating inside with booth seating along the walls, bar seating and community seating. So, with it being counter service, I wasn't nervous about not having a place to sit. I ordering a cardamom latte which ended up complementing their House Cured Wild Salmon Toast really well. The only thing I'd point out was that the crust of the toast was a bit too crunchy for my preference. Perhaps I'll try a different bread option next time! If you come during the weekend, my favourite weekend special right now has been their Croque Monsieur. Though I wish they had an option to make it a Croque Madame with an egg on top! Does Mr West University Village compare to my long time favourite Mr West Seattle? Yes, in other ways, by providing cafe seating perfect for shoppers who need a quick break or people like myself who wants somewhere casual, besides Starbucks, as a third place to get some work done or meet for coffee. It also offered a marketplace section for specialty things and a selection of wine for purchase. So, the addition for Mr West was definitely a correct choice, a much needed one for the plaza.","4","9/27/2019","145","Mr West Cafe Bar","56 reviews","2685 NE Village Ln","Wine Bars","http://yelp.com/biz/mr-west-cafe-bar-seattle-4","4"

"496","146","Hands down my favorite steak house right now. It is so affordable and the steak is sooooo juicy and perfectly cooked. You must order the smushed potatoes!!!!! It's just basically mashed potatoes that's soo smooth and flavorful. Like I can't believe how flavorful it is and you don't even need gravy!!?! It looks basic but it. Is. Amazing. Do order the American wagyu because FYI please call in advance if you want Kobe wagyu! I always forget to order in advance so we always settle with the American wagyu and some juicy fatty rib eye steak and it never let us down. Two steaks is enough for my boyfriend and I.The uni alfredo fettuccine is a must order: sooo creamy and good and I am so sad that I didn't know they rotate their menu so I had to settle for the tomato uni fettuccine and it's not that great compared to the uni Alfredo one so if you see that one on the menu order it!!!! The wagyu sashimi is also sooo tasty and so cool to order. it is definitely instagram worthy because they use the flame to cook it in front of you.For drinks get the grape sour!!!!

"498","146","This place is definitely a hidden gem! My friends and I came for restaurant week and sat at the bar, which I would say is one of the best places to sit because you get to peek at the chef prep all the dishes from the appetizers to the entree! It was a fun experience.We also happened to pick up some dishes from the happy hour menu. We got the veggie chips and the Shishamo fritters. The veggie chips were okay- not our favorite because the red colored chip tasted a little stale and bitter. The Shishamo fritters with a squeeze of lemon were amazing. The fish was tender, the seasoning was on point, and the dipping sauce elevated the dish.As for SRW- we got the Wagyu Oshi-Sushi and Wagyu terrine as appetizers, Wagyu steak and Beef Cheek stew for our main course, and the soy sauce ice cream and fire cheesecake for dessert. All of the dishes were spectacular. I especially loved the Wagyu Oshi-Sushi, it was flavored very well and it left me wanting more! The terrine was just fine. The Wagyu steak was nicely cooked with a nice light dipping sauce on the side and the beef cheeks were tender, the sauce in this dish was amazing! We also loved both desserts, the soy sauce ice cream was a mix of savory and sweet so that was different and the fire cheesecake was very subtle, but the texture was what made it memorable!

"500","146","Caught the tail end of happy hour which runs from 430-630.  Got the Kokkaku sour which comes with a frozen completely sliced lemon for $6 and wagyu mac and cheese ($10).  I liked the sour and it looked quite instagrammy with the tall row of lemon slices, however, the mac and cheese just tasted like it had regular ground beef and no cheese pull.  Order the sour and not the mac and cheese.We ordered the whole Seattle Restaurant week menu.  This was definitely not A5.  American wagyu was used throughout the menu.  Here are my thoughts:Japanese bagna cauda with saikyo miso dipping sauce:  completely vegan and prettiest out of the three appetizers.  Had cute baby carrots in a clay pot of potato salad minus the egg as well as steamed broccoli and some sweet pepper slices.  Radish slices were presented beautifully and drizzled with oil and salt.  I did enjoy the dipping sauce though I could also see the same sauce on a salad of greens.Seared wagyu beef oshi-sushi:  thin slices of wagyu on top of seasoned rice.  Nice presentation with the blowtorch, though they should use a bigger one because it ran out of propane often.  Wish it had more beef, but I love beef more than rice.Wagyu beef terrine with ikura:  Very good when paired with the bread and butter for 2.50 extra.  Would order again.  Beef was well seasoned and paired well with the salty popping ikura.Entree:Uni tomato cream fettucine:  least liked of the three.  Was more tomato based forward even though we did see lumps of uni.  Would have liked it more if it was creamier.Braised wagyu beef cheek with lentils:  Very tender and went well with the bread.  GET THE BREAD!  Helps sop up the broth which is very good.Wagyu beef steak with fingerling potatoes and tomatoes:  executed well.  Very tender.  Worth the most out of the three entrees.Desserts:  Mixed feelings.Hoji-tea cream with Kuromitsu:  I could see flecks of the hoji tea which was nice, but felt that the Kuromitsu over powered it so it was just as sweet and creamy as the next dessert...Fire cheesecake:  Nice presentation with the blowtorch and seeing the cream melt off the cheesecake.  When eaten side by side with the Hoji-tea cream, the texture seemed almost the same.  Very fluffy and same level of sweetness.   Soy sauce ice cream:  most intriguing of the three.  Had crunchy bits on the edge of the plate to add more texture which I enjoyed.  I liked that it had a salty component compared to the other sweet desserts.  I'm so glad I had friends to share all of them with.Overall, good experience for the money.  Anything with wagyu is worth getting.  Order the side of toasted bread and butter, you'll need it for the braised beef cheeks and beef terrine.","4","10/29/2019","146","Kokkaku","161 reviews","2208 N 45th St","American (New)","http://yelp.com/biz/kokkaku-seattle","4"
"501","146","What a nice start for SRW for Fall 2019! Their menu were generous as the more expensive items were included on the SRW menu.  The food were good, and had me convinced to try the other new things.  Maybe actually call 2 days in advanced for the Japanese Wagyu! We are a group of 8 and we were easily accommodated and the service was great! So with the large group like ours, we basically had everything on the SRW menu.  Here were the best for me:- Uni Tomato- Cream fettuccine: I wanted to lick the plate. - Braised Wagyu Cheeks with Lentils: very bold flavor, and the Wagyu was melt in your mouth.  I just wished the soup was not too much so I can enjoy more of the lentils. I think that's a personal preference. - Seared Wagyu and fire cheesecake: they were yummy, but really coz they torched it. The only thing that were a little meh was the ribeye and the cocktails. The ribeye was just probably too well done for our liking - however it might've been great.  And the cocktails were just ok.  I  should've ordered my whiskey neat instead. It was overall a great experience, and will totally recommend and come back.","4","10/28/2019","146","Kokkaku","161 reviews","2208 N 45th St","American (New)","http://yelp.com/biz/kokkaku-seattle","4"
"502","146","I had the best beef I ever ate and the worst beef that I ever ate, all in one place! The best was Waygu Four Way (hands down)! I wish I could have eaten that for the whole meal. Each bite was such a delight! The beef just melted in my mouth.The worst was Sasebo Lemon Steak (thin cut). When I got it, the steak was so hard to cut. My steak knife is sharp, but not sharp enough to slice through this tough beef. I had to ask for some SCISSORS to chop them up. I never had this problem with steak before, and now I know not to order thin cut steaks in the future. It was the toughest, chewiest steak I ever ate. Totally ruined the meal because I went from the best beef to the worst in less than an hour.I would totally come back for the four way though. Also, they gave samples of their homemade jerky for waiting. The jerky was softer than the lemon steak.Servers were nice, but the food took a while to come out (hence free jerky). I made a reservation on Yelp on the same day, which was convenient.

Entree:* Wagyu Beef Steak 8oz = Even though we got medium rare, I was chewing on the steak for awhile. Best part was the potatoes...* Uni Tomato-Cream Fettuccine = Me and my friend have been on an uni craving, decent twist to it. Dessert:* Panna Cotta = delicousssss* Fire Cheese cake = also pretty cool that they torch it in front of you but not much flavor to it. It was like a block of solid milk.

"505","146","I was actually so excited to to try this place. We went for dinner and the experience was extremely disappointing, it was so bad i had to come out of my hiatus from writing reviews.I had made reservations for 830 and we were seated around 845, a lot of people were done eating but just sitting around so we had to wait for a table to open up. The girl that led us to our seats looked stressed and annoyed and looked this way for pretty much our whole dinner. We had to ask for menus to look at and she just seemed irritated anytime we asked for anything.Most of the servers here looked like the hated their job. It was really unnerving. On top of that they charged us for the wrong table's bill which ended up being more, they fixed this but did not apologize at all and again just looked annoyed.I had not realized it was Restaurant Week and we ended up ordering everything on the restaurant week menu. The food was okay. The wagyu beef  sushi was good and its kind of awesome that they sear it for you tableside. The Bagna Cauda and Rilletes were fine but nothing special.  All the other dishes were pretty underwhelming. The steak we received was chewy, the Uni Fettuccine was okay (I've had better), and the soy sauce icecream was just too salty. The food did not make up for the appalling service, will definitely never come back or recommend.","2","10/31/2019","146","Kokkaku","161 reviews","2208 N 45th St","American (New)","http://yelp.com/biz/kokkaku-seattle","4"
"506","146","Babe picked this spot for a date night and I am so glad she did! The whole experience was great. We spent probably 2 hours here but it didn't feel like long, the food took a bit to come out but it was well worth it, pacing was good. The chef comes out and checks on the tables and where they are at, so that was cool. Definitely got a little warm inside the restaurant. We ordered the Shishamo Fritter; didn't know what it was to be honest but I like fried things, it was a fish stuffed with eggs. This was our least favorite appetizer, it wasn't bad but it just wasn't our style. Got the Seared Wagyu Sushi; incredible, melted in your mouth! Thin sliced beef, flavorful rice, and they flame broil it on the table. The other appetizer we got was the Cesar salad; it wasn't like a basic salad. It had cheddar wisp/crips, diced sized bacon and croutons, it was over dressed and I loved it. It also comes with a soft boiled egg. As for entrees, we got the Zabuton Steak and Wagyu Bolognese Linguine. The meat was medium rare and really flavorful, I enjoyed it a lot. Had a slight chew and the smallest amount of char on the sides. Bolognese was so so so yummy! Honestly, I was full halfway through the entrees but I kept eating until there was nothing left. Price wise, it wasn't bad. I would even say it was pretty affordable for the quality we received. Definitely want to come back and try the Wagyu Four Ways!","4","9/7/2019","146","Kokkaku","161 reviews","2208 N 45th St","American (New)","http://yelp.com/biz/kokkaku-seattle","4"
"507","146","We visited this relatively secret spot for restaurant week. I've lived in this neighborhood for years and I had no clue this steakhouse was hidden here. They had a great selection for restaurant week, the appetizers were both fantastic, the main steak was excellent and perfectly cooked and charred and the desserts were so tasty! I would highly recommend it. Even their house red wine was pretty darn good!","5","11/12/2019","146","Kokkaku","161 reviews","2208 N 45th St","American (New)","http://yelp.com/biz/kokkaku-seattle","4"
"508","146","Came here last night with my boyfriend and left disappointed. We ordered:- Seared Wagyu Sushi- Wagyu 4 ways - Wagyu Bolognese Linguine- Ton KatsuWe got in around 815pm and the restaurant wasn't busy at all which was nice. But we waited for our main entrees for about 20-30 minutes. Waiting for our entrees wasn't the bad part. They gave a table that came in after us our Bolognese and rice for our Ton Katsu. Realizing 5 minutes later that they gave it to the wrong table, they took the pasta from them and gave it us......The other table munched on the rice so waiter told them to keep the rice. But the restaurant didn't have enough rice for us so we had order something else for a substitute.... We got potatoes which didn't mesh well with Ton Katsu. Lastly, they tried to charge us for the potatoes even though it was a substitute for something they ran out of???Food was decent. But our first time experience here sucked. Probably won't return.","2","10/20/2019","146","Kokkaku","161 reviews","2208 N 45th St","American (New)","http://yelp.com/biz/kokkaku-seattle","4"
"509","146","So good! Visited for SRW and everything we ordered was great. Food is very flavorful with high quality ingredients. The beef terrine was a delightful surprise. I didn't know what to expect because there were a lot of foreign cuisine terms. It tasted like a pate with a beef jerky taste. Weird yet delicious. The wagyu steak was super tender and juicy. We also got the uchi fettuccine and it's very fishy...but the sauce was light and creamy. Strange but good. I think that sums up their whole menu. Combinations and twists that I've never had but yet always pleasantly surprised. Even the soy sauce ice cream was good! Service was cordial and attentive. I will definitely comeback.","5","11/7/2019","146","Kokkaku","161 reviews","2208 N 45th St","American (New)","http://yelp.com/biz/kokkaku-seattle","4"

Started off with Wagyu 4 ways for each of us - such a fun tasting of wagyu with excellent flavors. We also got the waygu sushi which is super cool since they cook it to a medium rare via a torch at your table! Then got the waygu steak with potatoes. Also had the seared scallops (this was OK but I guess the focus here is steak anyway!)Only complaint is that the food took a while, but it made for good conversation!Not as pricey as we expected, will definitely come back!","5","7/15/2019","146","Kokkaku","161 reviews","2208 N 45th St","American (New)","http://yelp.com/biz/kokkaku-seattle","4"

"512","146","There are lots of mixed reviews about this place but bottom line is they do a stand up job when it comes to meat. There was a bit of a snafu with our reservation through Yelp but they corrected it with no problem. We came in and were immediately seated but it took a verrrrrrry long time to get service-even for them to come and take our drink order. We noticed a group that came in after us was served before we were so that didn't help. They appeared to have a somewhat inefficient system where they did not have a designated bartender and the servers were making all the drinks and thus our server didn't get to us for about 20-25 minutes. But when they finally did come over to say hello and take our order, the servers were personable and the food came out pretty quickly. Since we had more than enough time to look over the menu we went ahead and placed our drink, appetizer and entree orders in fear it'd be another half hour before we'd be able to order again. Drinks were pretty good but the apps were amazing. We each got an order of the seared wagyu (which comes as a pair and they sear tableside). You might think, 7 pairs of this app?! Trust me, it's very good. Next was the wagyu four ways. Again, seven orders of this app. You won't regret it and you won't want to share (about $15/person). Caesar salad was good and comes with a poached egg and the mizuna salad looks like a plate full of grass but I enjoyed it. As far as entrees, the wagyu is the way to go. All the meat is served with a roasted garlic and tomato and a perfect accoutrement to the delicious meat. I usually love ribeye most but I've got to say the wagyu they serve was much better than the ribeye. Either way, order some sort of meat. Finally, the cheesecake they serve is bomb. Their panna cotta was also a crowd favorite and the soy sauce ice cream is different but not really memorable. Oh, and $15 corkage fee! Really cool spot away from the hustle and bustle of downtown.","4","6/26/2019","146","Kokkaku","161 reviews","2208 N 45th St","American (New)","http://yelp.com/biz/kokkaku-seattle","4"

"515","146","Visited during SRW.  Although it says on the official website that no reservations are needed but when we arrived they made us wait for over 40 minutes saying that because we didn't make a reservation.The food was below okay.  The rice portion of Seard Wagyu Beef Oshi Sushi was not shaped into what a sushi is supposed to be and the beef was dry.  The Wagyu Beef Steak was extremely dry and lack of flavor.  Braised Wagyu Beef Cheek with Lentils was the only dish that we really enjoyed.  The dessert was disaster!  The cheese cake had no cheese taste.  Hoji Tea Panna Cotta tasted like greasy overnight aged cream.  Couldn't finish it all.  Quite disappointed.","2","10/31/2019","146","Kokkaku","161 reviews","2208 N 45th St","American (New)","http://yelp.com/biz/kokkaku-seattle","4"

The bread is so soft, the chicken breaded and fried perfectly then with a fresh slaw and spicy aioli. They are on happy hour but the regular portion is perfect   I also love the lollipop corn dogs.

"517","147","I love their food and drinks, but I cannot stand their customer service. The times I have been there, I've felt completely ignored, and they seemed annoyed because we brought in a group of people (which we reserved ahead of time). But today was the last straw, and I didn't even go in today. I ordered the steak salad wrap from Uber eats. The app didn't give me the option to add avocado, but I placed the order anyway. I called and asked them if I could add avocado to my order, offering to pay for it over the phone. They said no. Then I offered to pay more than what the charge of avocado would be and they still said no. I understand that they have a business to run and that my charge would have been an inconvenience to them, but coming from someone who has also worked in customer service, I would have just added the avocado with a charge. Let me not forget to mention, the steak salad wrap cost 20$ and the delivery fee was 17$. So, in total I paid 44$ for a wrap and couldn't receive a 3$ avocado. . I tried canceling the order after they said that but they would have charged me 22$ regardless. So, needless to say, this dinner I was so looking forward to have turned into an expensive wrap without the avocado I loved. Honestly, if your in U-Village, just head over to Joey's. Great food and even better customer service.","1","10/19/2019","147","Eureka!","659 reviews","2614 NE 46th St","American (New)","http://yelp.com/biz/eureka-seattle-4","3"
"518","147","This past Friday, was our fourth time that we had come here to eat. We come for the chili, chicken sliders, and the yam fries. The weather was windy and raining and my husband and I were cold and tired after a long week at work. So we decided to come here for our comfort food. I was glad that they could seat us right away. We ordered the usual. When the chili arrived I was so excited and after the first bite, I was so disappointed since the Chili was cold. Yike. When you are cold and come for chili, the worst thing is cold chili. The manager took my chili to warm it up. By the time the chili came back, i had finished eaten the sweet potato fries (very few of them) without the chili since I was hungry. The chili arrived almost when my husband has finished his meal and to begin with, this delay was a disappointment to start with since it took away from the experience of our date night. The chili came back very dry and the color had changed as though they had fried the chili. I took a bite and it burnt the heck out of my mouth. My tongue was burnt and the skin from the roof of my mouth came off. So painful. So not only the chili was not good, but it was DANGEROUSLY hot. The waitress took the chili away and said we will not charge you. That is not a great customer service since I didn't eat anything so, for sure they had to take this off of our bill. But no apologies or anything. I was dumbfounded of how poor the service is and how they didn't care that their food caused pain. I asked to speak with the manager, Amanda. She was not better. When I told her the my mouth is so burnt and is painful, she said "we tried to bring the chili back to the right temp." Well, the right temp is not so dang hot that causes burn. She said, "we took it off your bill." Yes you did, because it was not edible. When I told her how disappointing it is to come in for a date night after a long week working for your comfort food and have an experience like this, she said, "sorry". That is it. When I told her that I am going to write a review on Yelp and Google on this experience, she said, "wait, I can give you a couple of comp coupons for a free meal." Amanda, I can pay for my own meals, but you should have offered that when our food was wrong and when I burnt my tongue. For me, this shows how poorly managed is this restaurant. 1. the cook/chef doesn't know the right temp for food2. the waitress didn't understand a thing about customer service and treated us like a cattle that we need to get out and not charging us for a food item that we could not eat was a great customer service.3. The shift manger, Amanda, had no clue the seriousness of this issue of food safety and she had no idea of how to handle this. She just tried to do something after i said I am going to write a review. I hope this review will be viewed as a call to action by the GM to improve customer service and food safety. Very disappointed and even two days later, I can't eat much due to my burnt mouth.","1","9/29/2019","147","Eureka!","659 reviews","2614 NE 46th St","American (New)","http://yelp.com/biz/eureka-seattle-4","3"
"519","147","Update: I just noticed the restaurant's GM, Mr. Cosgrove, send me a message and apologize for the bad experience we had about the food.  And offering me a giftcard for us to go back to give them a second chance.  Regardless to our previous experience, I have to credit the managements who are willing to reach out to their customer and attempt to make things right.  That mean a lot to me, as a consumer.  And just for that, I am updating my starts from 1 to 3 to show my appreciation.  Thank you, Mr. Gosgrove.=================================================We stopped by for a quick lunch yesterday.The waitress that served us, Jenn (got the name from our receipt), was awesome! She was super friendly, and attentive to us.We were seated on a little tiny two seaters by the wall.  After we placed the order, we saw there were three bigger tables were empty, and it wasn't during the rush hour, so I asked the waiter who were right next to us, to see if we could move to one of those bigger tables.  He was very friendly, and told us, sure that shouldn't be a problem, and he was going to talk to our waitress / hostess/someone about the seat change for us.  But few mins went by, the nice gentleman came back and told us that those seats were on waitlist already for someone else, so he can't switch the table for us.  I could feel the guy feel sorry for not able to switch the table for us and I feel kind sorry for put him on the spot to feel sorry for us.  So I guess that was it and life went on.  And then until we finished our lunch and took off, our side of the restaurant were only get emptier and emptier, and those three tables that I was hoping to move to, has always been empty during our entire stay.... so....  I guess my request to switch to a more comfortable seats during their non-rush hours was totally unreasonable for their management..... I feel ashamed of myself making such a horrible request.....Food wise, we ordered a Fish and Chips, and American Cheeseburger.Pro:1. we ordered unsalted fries for our side dish.  Fries for both of our plates were one of the best that we have ever tasted.  I am not sure if its their seasoning, or the texture of the fries, or whatever the magic they put on it, Fries is absolutely amazing.Con:1. The Fish seems to be too dark in color to me, as if they have not change oil of their fryer for a very long time kind of dark.  When my fish and chip plate was served, my first thought was maybe they over-fried the fish and it was going to be like a solid rock.  However, after eat into it.  even bread looked dark and hard solid, it was actually pretty soft.  After digged into it more, I started to taste mix of batter + fish + skin.... almost like inner part of the batter was not cooked/fried and its still raw.  My guess was, again, that its possible they haven't change their dirty oil of the fryer for a long time, and when they fried the fish, it became excessively dark too soon, so they have to take it out before its properly cooked...2. we ordered our cheeseburger in medium.  Most part of it was pretty good, until we started to taste bitterness / burned from the meat, and not sure why some part of the meat could be badly burned for a medium done burger?Price wise, its $17 for fish and chip, and $12.50 for a cheese burger, and $5 for a tiny glass of Lemonade.  I think its excessively expensive for what I get, but that's the price of dining in this city /area, so I won't be a crying baby about it.However, if you asked me if I ever coming back again? My answer is no.  We had a fantastic experience with the waitress who served us, and that's about the only memory that I will take with me for this place.  There are way too many other places that we could go for much better quality of food, and willing to accommodate to my unreasonable requests.","3","9/22/2019","147","Eureka!","659 reviews","2614 NE 46th St","American (New)","http://yelp.com/biz/eureka-seattle-4","3"
"520","147","A great option for University Village especially with its excellent food safety rating.  (I had the misfortune of eating at an Asian spot here which is popular since a friend insisted and fell really sick afterwards and later noticed that restaurant has a super low needs improvement rating).  We loved the patio especially with our pup in tow.  It was a pleasant evening.  The fried chicken sliders were yummy but definitely not filling enough without fries. They were sweet because we eliminated the firecracker aioli (spicy), but overall they were satisfactory and definitely a great choice. The Napa Chicken Sandwich was great. The chicken was moist and flavorful and the oven-roasted tomato exploded inside your mouth. It was a bit filling, and the bread (while delicious) was the main reason why. It was very good though and something worth ordering again. The fish tacos were wonderful. They were an appropriately sized portion and satisfying, with a little kick of spice. If you don't mind spice, it's a great order! The kids' chicken tenders were great. In the seven year old's words: "They were very nice and crunchy and fresh". They were a hit and with the fries made a nicely filling kids meal. We would definitely go back the next time we are in University Village and would recommend it to any other families who are looking for dinner in the area!","4","7/27/2019","147","Eureka!","659 reviews","2614 NE 46th St","American (New)","http://yelp.com/biz/eureka-seattle-4","3"

Nachos are good and have a sweet taste to it which I enjoyed but was definitely a small portion compared to other restaurants and their portion of nachos.

It was a sunny hot day in Seattle so we sat outside on their little covered patio area. My opinion, Eureka! Is known for their endless amount of beer options. I ordered a honey blonde beer and my girlfriend ordered the watermelon cocktail beverage my girlfriend said her drink was one of the best cocktails she has ever had. For dinner I ordered the Napa Chicken Sandwhich that was amazing. I am allergic to tree nuts and the sandwich usually comes with Pesto but I subbed it out with a garlic aioli and it was perfect! Very moist sand which and wasn't to heavy with my beer. My gf ordered the blackened fish tacos and she enjoy them.

I paid $14 for an okay burger and 14 sweet potato fries. Yes, I took the time to count them and photograph them because the value of this restaurant has substantially diminished and I vow to never come to Eureka again and will do everything in my power to discourage others from dining. A side of Brussels sprouts used to be a full 8 inch dish is now served as a 4 ounce condiment saucer. What used to be a full plate of fries is now only 14 individual spears.  It's like an abusive relationship that keeps taking more from you and giving you less.

The fries that accompanied the burgers were really salty! The corn tortillas that housed the fish tacos threw off the whole dish. The meat patty in the kimchi burger had a weird texture (pork + angus) and wasn't very succulent. Definitely needed some fresh veggies to brighten and lighten up the dish. The kimchi condiment was good tho. Service was a little wonky and our server was not very attentive at all. We had to ask for roll ups (we only had one on the table and there were 4 of us) linens, forks, and for her to remove menus. The manager, however, was very helpful and kind (black gingham shirt w/ short blonde hair). The restroom was clean and there's a changing table.

"529","147","3.5* - came in on a late weekday lunch and it was pretty empty but I think it was timing. I've been here for drinks only before during game days and it gets pretty packed but this review is for the lunch. We were seated right away with choice of tables and service was good but could have been better. We didn't get any refill on our drinks until we flagged someone down. First time having their food and we ordered the glazed Brussels sprouts, falafel bites as appetizers and the grilled shrimp salad and short rib burger naked (without the bun). The Brussels sprouts were a tad on a sweet side but charred well so it was balanced. The falafel while tasty was a bit oily. As for the main course, here was where I was more disappointed. The shrimp salad had some rice noodles in there and were al dente, well more like under cooked. As for the short rib burger, I probably shouldn't have ordered it naked, since it came with a arugula salad underneath the burger with lemon vinaigrette. The flavor clashed with the Kim chi on the burger and tasted just odd. I'd give this place another go when I'm around the area and I'll be sure to keep the bun on this time.","3","1/22/2019","147","Eureka!","659 reviews","2614 NE 46th St","American (New)","http://yelp.com/biz/eureka-seattle-4","3"

"538","148","If you're a UW student, use the Student Survival kit coupon (booklets found in the UW Bookstore on the ave)!! Best savings ever, and cancels out the only con of this place: the price. If you're not a student (or even if you are), use the Belly rewards program: you can spend easily-earned points on upgrading your ramen bowl size, or rack up those points for a free appetizer or ramen. The restaurant has a beautiful aesthetic, and amazing amazing food. The ramen noodles have just the right amount of bite, and the broth is rich and flavorful. You can really taste the time and quality of ingredients they put into that soup. Also, you really can't go wrong with any of the ramen choices, but my favorite is the miso. Also, the pork is *incredibly* tender, and you won't be able to look at pork belly the same way again. Also service is great-- the staff is very helpful, and will happily cater to your needs.

I usually like to order the ramen combo with a small ramen, egg, and gyoza. Unfortunately, they're not so good with sides, and I've been served burned gyoza and overcooked egg more than once. Service is inconsistent as well; sometimes I'm made to wait before being seated if my friend is still parking even though the entire restaurant is completely empty.Its also not super clean, and if you're sitting next to the wall just be careful not to touch or rest your elbow on the little ledge because it's filthy.","4","10/8/2019","148","Hokkaido Ramen Santouka - Seattle","218 reviews","2626 NE Village Ln","Ramen","http://yelp.com/biz/hokkaido-ramen-santouka-seattle-seattle","3"

Our waiter and hostess seemed a bit flustered lol which is understandable. I got the miso ramen and it was ready pretty fast. The noodles had a good subtle chew to it but the broth was a bit salty. The portion wasn't very satisfying; I got the regular size and I wasn't really full after. I wish there was overall more content because I think I only found three small shoots of bamboo and one slice of pork belly.

"541","148","While I have to admit that my overall Ramen knowledge is less than some, I feel like I can appreciate when people know what they are doing. Anyone who likes to eat good food can attest to the fact that when someone knows what they are doing, it shows up in their work. In the same way that you don't need to be an architect to know when a building looks nice, a solid bowl of Ramen passes the taste test. That was my experience here!One of our little guys and I stopped in after a visit to a clinic down here and receded promptly despite it being the noon hour. The place was busy,But not so much that we had to wait a long time to be seated. We ordered an appetizer of Karaage chicken and some Goma Miso Ramen. I don't know what they use on the chicken, but it was delicious! Light batter and a nice lighter flavor for a fried dish - healthy carbs right!The ramen was top notch. I'd never had broth that had a "silky" characteristic previously, but that has now changed! The broth was rich, very flavorful and had that silky character that was just lovely- it probably means there's a lot of butter in it! The noodles were done perfectly and the "regular" size was plenty for myself and my little guy. They got us in and out quick, service was friendly and they even got us a little box to go for the extra chicken. A great experience and one we'll likely be back to repeat!","5","10/5/2019","148","Hokkaido Ramen Santouka - Seattle","218 reviews","2626 NE Village Ln","Ramen","http://yelp.com/biz/hokkaido-ramen-santouka-seattle-seattle","3"

The amount of meat they give you in a bowl isn't that much though, but I don't mind because I had appetizers too and a side of egg. I love how the egg is so runny and goes with the ramen so well, I haven't tried the egg alone the because I'm not a fan of cold eggs, but with the ramen, it's just great. This place and Kizuki and the only ramen places I have been, and I prefer this place over Kizuki. The service is great and they also give students a discount which is amazing.

Gyoza is a little too greasy, there was oil dripping and it burned a little. I personally like to dip the gyoza with vinegar and chili oil, but soy sauce with chili oil is great too!

"544","148","Miso Ramen $11 for small: When I first sipped the broth, I thought it was pretty good. I ordered the corn and butter topping $3 and was surprised that it came on the side.

I still slurped up all the broth, but will skip on ordering this topping next time. *****My Star Ratings: 1 Star - Terrible. Just thinking about it makes me angry. 2 Stars - Meh.

I got the Shoyu Ramen combo with Chashu and it was great. I got the regular which is a little on the small side so I'd probably get the large next time. But I really do like that they offer smaller options since ramen can be really rich somtimes. It's in U-Village so the prices seem pretty on par with what you'd expect there.

"546","148","Craving for some Ramen and came across this place in U village area.   Definitely did not disappoint me. I am not a fan of Cha-Siu so I usually try their basic broth. Their veggie broth is a thick broth. Comes with a few bamboo shoots and a piece of fried bean paste. The noodles is just the right texture, not too hard or overly cooked.  It still have the chewiness to it.  The broth is bold and not salty.  I will say it is one of the best I have ever tried. The appetizers are pretty impressive too. The Karaage is nice and crispy and Tokoyaki is as good as any Tokoyaki in many stores.   This place also have broth-less noodles. Looks so good, makes me want to try them. UW students received discount for the entire bill. That's quite nice. For just one more dollars, you can make it a larger size, why not. Next time when I stop by, will try the broth-less noodles for sure.","5","9/18/2019","148","Hokkaido Ramen Santouka - Seattle","218 reviews","2626 NE Village Ln","Ramen","http://yelp.com/biz/hokkaido-ramen-santouka-seattle-seattle","3"

I've always ordered their combo though since that's the best deal that they have in my opinion:FOOD:Shoyu ramen -  would recommend this ramen for those who like a more flavorful taste than the miso ramen (which is also good). I really like this ramen out of the others because it's not too heavy and also I can't do spicy so this is perfect for low tolerance spiced individuals!Goma Miso ramen - this one was pretty heavy and for some reason it had a an after taste to it with each sip of the soup (bitter taste to it) which I didn't like too much but it was still good!Shiyake (salmon rice bowl) - I always like to save the rice bowls as a next meal because the ramen is enough to fill me up. I really like this bowl because the salmons soft and it's just good LOL it's not too salty. Just has good flavor to it. Cha Shu bowl - this one's really good too. The pork is so soft and so juicy. The cha shu is also used in the ramen bowl but they have a side where it's just Cha shu in a rice bowl. They braise the meat really well in my opinion. ENVIRONMENT/SERVICE: lots of seating!

It's been getting pretty cold these past few days so my husband and I, along with a couple of our friends, decided to check this ramen place out. Their wait system is easy, you add your name to the virtual waitlist on the iPad so that you can walk around and you'll receive a text once your table is ready. It was crowded when we went but luckily the wait time wasn't too bad. I particularly enjoy their combo sets. I ordered the gyoza set with the shio ramen which comes with gyozas and your choice of salad or ajitama. For the price, it wasn't too bad of a deal.

"554","148","This is probably more of a 3 stores restaurant but I deducted one star for the excess oil and salt.Nestled in the main aisle of University Village, Hokkaido Ramen Santouka is a transplant directly from Japan.  Famous for its variety of broths, made at each of its restaurants, it offers noodle slurpy goodness for its customers - provided you like the greasy and salt too.  That's where I am nit-picking...For the most part, I get true ramen lean on being saltier and because a good stock is made from bones, it also leans on being oily.  BUT, it shouldn't be glistening with oil reflecting the light, as seen in first photo, Tonkotsu Shouyu Ramen.  Sigh.  The intense saltiness left quite an after-taste that I immediate went looking for something else to eat and drink to temper the residual effects in my mouth.  Sigh #2.On a positive note, the meat is very tender, the noodles are perfectly al-dente, the soft boiled egg - aji-tama is a guilty pleasure in its own right, licking up every bit of the yolky-goodness.I also thought the cost is a touch high, perhaps that is attributable to the University Village location and that it's a branded ramen shop.","2","3/25/2019","148","Hokkaido Ramen Santouka - Seattle","218 reviews","2626 NE Village Ln","Ramen","http://yelp.com/biz/hokkaido-ramen-santouka-seattle-seattle","3"

I ordered the Shio Ramen, which was delicious, very rich, and tasted more like a tonkotsu ramen (for you shio sticklers out there). I also ordered the mentaiko rice, which was yummy but unusual (the mentaiko was sitting on top of egg salad, and the roe wasn't "loose" like it usually it is, which would make eating it a little more intimidating to people unfamiliar/uncomfortable with fish roe).The restaurant is quite noisy and has lots of small tables.

Here's an example: the kale Caesar salad used to come with large chunks of cucumbers, tempeh bacon, avocados, and croutons. The last few times I've ordered this, these items were practically non-existent. Maybe three croutons, a teaspoon of tempeh crumbs (yes, crumbs), and tiny bits of avocado?

This really bums me out as we don't have many places to choose from, here, as vegans. However, the food is now very sub par and bordering on impossible to eat. I had their bacon Mac n cheese and was really disappointed as it was bland, mystery flavored, and topped with what I can only assume is burned dog treats. Plus, they've gone down on their french fry portions; I'm fairly sure I received 7 1/2 fries with my weird soggy onion mystery sauce burger ( the same sauce that came with the "Mac n cheese"..lucky me), last time I went. I left feeling like I had just been robbed and force fed the physical manifestation of dissatisfaction; I didn't enjoy that.

"570","149","Man, I am sad to update my review, but I have had some issues at this place lately. This is a restaurant I frequent because it is close by and accommodates my vegetarian parents. The first incident was when I ordered Korea Street Tacos, something I frequently order, and the presentation was sloppy. They were difficult to eat without making a crazy mess, even by normal taco-eating standards. I was willing to let this slide and gave U Village VG another change. Then a couple weeks later, my husband and I both got the BBQ fried chicken platter, and both of us received extremely cold food. Then just the other day my B-Wing salad was missing avocado. The woman sitting at the table behind me alerted a server that her meal was also missing avocado. She received a pretty unfriendly and confused response, so I decided to keep my complaint to myself. I have to say that the B-Wing salad was super spicy without the avocado to complement it. My husband also got a completely different item than what he ordered. He ordered the Backyard Spicy Fried Chicken Bowl but I think received some variation of the Filipino Chickin' Adobo Bowl. I also had to exchange my drink cup because there was food and a foreign hair in it. I don't usually think that's a big deal, but when I exchanged it, the employee was frazzled and said she was running low on cups. Anyways, I hope to see some resolution to these issues, because I would hate to see the U Village Veggie Grill go downhill. I love Veggie Grill, but I feel that these are some pretty egregious errors in a short period of time.","2","7/19/2018","149","Veggie Grill","389 reviews","2681 NE University Village St","American (New)","http://yelp.com/biz/veggie-grill-seattle-4","4"
"571","149","Let me first and foremost say that I love the food at Veggie Grill (when it is prepared correctly). However, I came here once during the summer and they flat out burned me meal - to which I complained about and got a free meal voucher. Upon returning again recently with a friend, I checked my credit card bill online, I saw that they  had increased the tip that I put on the bill by a few dollars!Now I totally believe in paying people a fair living wage, but dishonesty is another thing. Really Veggie Grill - was it REALLY worth the extra $3 on a 10 dollar meal? You have lost my trust as a customer.","1","1/1/2019","149","Veggie Grill","389 reviews","2681 NE University Village St","American (New)","http://yelp.com/biz/veggie-grill-seattle-4","4"
"572","149","I had the vegetarian version of chicken and that was a mistake and a half. Why you may ask? Because I had the absolute worst gas of my life...FOR A WEEK! Imagine sitting in class, dead silent in the lecture hall. Then suddenly you are the culprit of that tiny fly that was released from your behind.At least it tasted like chicken.","2","1/4/2019","149","Veggie Grill","389 reviews","2681 NE University Village St","American (New)","http://yelp.com/biz/veggie-grill-seattle-4","4"
"573","149","I'm not a vegetarian but I do like veggie grill! I have a lot of vegetarian family and friends and this is our go to place! This is located in University Village, which means parking is almost always packed however the restaurant itself is never too busy! But I will say they do take a long time to prepare the food no matter how busy/slow it is! Most times the staff apologizes but I'm never in a hurry so I don't really mind! The customer service is good! They answered all my questions when I first came and are very accommodating when they run out of something I wanted to order! I usually order the buffalo wings which are my absolute favorite! I may even prefer them over actual wings! But I will say some days they don't taste as good! One time they were almost kinda soggy.... however that was only once but the other times they were okay food is really never hot.. makes me kinda skeptical! They are pretty pricey for the proportions! My order came out to be around 23$ when I ordered one sweet potatoes fries and two buffalo wings! I tried sweet potato fries for the first time today and they were surprisingly really tasty and I do recommend trying it out!  Giving it a three star because even though the food is okay, I've never had a great experience it's always okay! Mostly just convenient for my vegetarian friends!","3","1/28/2019","149","Veggie Grill","389 reviews","2681 NE University Village St","American (New)","http://yelp.com/biz/veggie-grill-seattle-4","4"

"575","149","It's a weird day when you catch me at a vegetarian/vegan place, but I'll do my best to be fair at least, given that I'm a huge carnivore. Upon arrival around 4pm Sunday the food wait was 30 mins coming out from the kitchen. The Tempura Green beans were the best, addicting and crispy with a good garlic ranch sauce (so good I dipped my regular fries into it). The Sante Fe "Chicken" sandwich was good, but I imagined it to be a healthier (more bland) McChicken with avocado and whole wheat bun. Looking back at my photo, they actually forgot the spicy mayo on it, but I was probably too hungry to care. The Mediterranean salad was not my cup of tea. The falafels (only 3 included) are actually well seasoned with spices, but the salad and soggy flat bread leave more to be desired.Take my ideally meat-eating 2 cents for what it's worth. Will I come back to try their "burgers"....for the expected taste and price probably not, but it's a healthy option out there. There's plenty of inside seating (some outside too) and parking is manageable enough on weekends.","4","5/9/2018","149","Veggie Grill","389 reviews","2681 NE University Village St","American (New)","http://yelp.com/biz/veggie-grill-seattle-4","4"
"576","150","This is byfar one of my favorite poke places right in the heart of U District! I have introduced so many people to this poke place, and they all love it and would come back! They have so many side options and you can pick and choose or get all of the toppings!! The size of the bowl is definitely worth the price as it is around $9-10 a bowl. I usually have enough to save for another meal!!! I would recommend getting the original(tuna) and getting the Japanese dressing!! Also a good idea if you do not want too much rice to ask for half salad and half rice! Only cons is that they don't open on Sundays and there are only 3-4 tables with two chairs. Would recommend getting to go and going to gas works if its a nice day or taking it back on campus to study!!","5","11/12/2019","150","Hiroshi's Poke","245 reviews","4712 11th Ave NE","Poke","http://yelp.com/biz/hiroshis-poke-seattle-3","4"
"577","150","I feel like I've rated every poke shop I've tried in Seattle a five star, but that's just how high the quality of poke here is. Hiroshi's is fantastic poke AND it's among some of the cheapest. It's only $8.50 for a small! I would absolutely recommend getting any of the tuna choices (I got the original). The salmon is really no good... it hardly tasted like salmon and it was heavily citrus-ey to the point of being too sour. That said, the tuna made up for this by being super fresh, rich, and tender. The original tuna was very well-marinated.As for the other toppings, they have a great selection of sauces and condiments. The spicy mayo was a good choice. I'd definitely recommend getting a scoop of their macaroni salad on the side. They have all the essentials (maybe a little lacking in the crispy toppings department). You get a ton of food. Super super value. Super dee duper fish (just not the salmon).","5","9/30/2019","150","Hiroshi's Poke","245 reviews","4712 11th Ave NE","Poke","http://yelp.com/biz/hiroshis-poke-seattle-3","4"
"578","150","This place is probably the most value I have ever gotten out of a poke place. The portions here are insane, and it's for only $10! Don't even think about getting the 2 choice, that is TOO MUCH FOOD. While I've definitely had better poke in terms of quality, it's still very high up here. Even with leaving the poke for about an hour at room temperature (I had some errands to run), it was still super delicious.I got the Hawaiian the last time I came, although I will say my favorite is the spicy tuna. The mac salad here is ADDICTING, but it's incredibly heavy, so I doubt I could even eat that much of it. Unlimited toppings are also a great perk, nothing to complain about at all on that front. Overall just a really chill and great place to get food. If you're in a rush to get something delicious and cheap, this is my choice for UDistrict's best value lunch.","4","9/12/2019","150","Hiroshi's Poke","245 reviews","4712 11th Ave NE","Poke","http://yelp.com/biz/hiroshis-poke-seattle-3","4"
"579","150","Hiroshi's has been my go-to place for poke as it was affordable and tasty. However, since it opened a few years ago, it only has been degrading. It took a lot of visit for me to update review and my experiences have been only disappointing.The service is not good, I don't get greeted and the employees seem very tired. It seems like the employees change every time I visit. The poke has been not the same as before. There is no consistency to it. The macaroni salad often actually taste like it is spoiled. I am actually sad to see this place not offering the same kind of experience as before and I think it is time for me to go find new poke spots in Seattle.","3","9/11/2019","150","Hiroshi's Poke","245 reviews","4712 11th Ave NE","Poke","http://yelp.com/biz/hiroshis-poke-seattle-3","4"
"580","150","One of the best poke shops in Seattle! You can get two options for about $11, which is cheaper than most poke shops, AND they give you a huge bowl for their heaping scoops of fish. I'm a big fan of the options they have like Hawaiian Poke and Lomi Lomi Salmon. They're different from regular poke bowls that have the same old spicy tuna and salmon. I really like their crab salad, macaroni salad, and seaweed salad because it tastes so fresh. I also like that they have edamame, which does not add extra fees like other places. They also have furikake, which is the best topping. Don't @ me. So basically what I'm saying is that if you want poke, come here.","5","8/9/2019","150","Hiroshi's Poke","245 reviews","4712 11th Ave NE","Poke","http://yelp.com/biz/hiroshis-poke-seattle-3","4"
"581","150","Hiroshi's Poke is one of the best poke shops in Seattle. The portion size is huge for what you get and you can probably get two meals out of one poke bowl. Their service is also very fast and the staff here is extremely nice. House Ahi Tuna: I love the ahi tuna poke. The sauce of the ahi tuna is a light soy sauce mix.Lomi Lomi Salmon: I love eating salmon , but it's a little too heavy on the citrus flavor.You can also get extras for any of the other ingredients of the poke bowl. I really like their mac salad and crab salad, so I always ask for extra of those. Their single fish choice where they give you 2-3 scoops of fish is about 9 dollars and the 2 scoop is 11 dollars before tax","5","8/28/2019","150","Hiroshi's Poke","245 reviews","4712 11th Ave NE","Poke","http://yelp.com/biz/hiroshis-poke-seattle-3","4"
"582","150","This place is by far the best poke place in Seattle because of its quality and the quantity! Here are a few of the fish I've tried:Spicy ahi - it's creamy and the tuna is fresh imo. It's not too spicyHouse ahi (I don't remember the exact name) - this one has a sweet soy sauce taste to it from their original sauce. This one is by far my favorite because of the sauce. Lomi lomi salmon - I love salmon and this one was great too. It's got more of a citrusy taste to it from the lemon and overall I guess less saucy compared to the other ones. One thing that I really like about this place is the amount that they give you. I can always manage to get two meals from one bowl of poke so it's very worth the price compared to other poke places. The helpings are generous :) This place is by far the closest thing to the poke in Hawaii!","5","6/16/2019","150","Hiroshi's Poke","245 reviews","4712 11th Ave NE","Poke","http://yelp.com/biz/hiroshis-poke-seattle-3","4"

For $10.50 you get a huge bowl with 2 proteins of choice. I opted for the Kona Bowl and loaded up on toppings. It was so full the cashier had to plastic wrap it! I had half for lunch and half for dinner and found it to be plenty.

"588","150","This has been on my "wanting to try" list for awhile now. I work in the U District, where there are so many options so it's hard to pick! I also was having a little bit of anxiety about picking the right combo here! I'm too indecisive. As it turned out, it was the right amount of choice and a low pressure ordering situation. You can see all the poke choices and just pick what looks best to you! I went with original tuna and spicy tuna. You then move down the line and add whatever toppings you want (like crab salad, edamame, cucumber). My only disappointment was that the "avocado" option (which is $1 extra) was really just guac squeezed out of a bag. I should have stopped her, but just scraped it off later. I went with a ponzu & spicy mayo sauce combo. You can have it with however much sauce you want. I didn't add any "seeds" but will probably do that next time for an extra kick. The fish tasted fresh and it was wayyy too big of a portion for one lunch (not complaining), so my husband will get the leftovers (wife of the year right here). Overall, a great lunch option and a good value!","4","2/21/2019","150","Hiroshi's Poke","245 reviews","4712 11th Ave NE","Poke","http://yelp.com/biz/hiroshis-poke-seattle-3","4"
"589","150","I came here after reading a review that the poke bowls had a lot of sauce and I was not disappointed. Great prices and value, as the poke bowls are HUGE! I still haven't been able to finish one, but they're awesome. I'm definitely going to be coming back the next time I'm in the area. The restaurant itself is not that large, with a seating area of ~4 tables. I've always gone during off peak times so this isn't too much of an issue. The staff are always very nice and accommodating, and are able to answer questions about options for your poke bowl as you go. I prefer their white sushi rice and the hawaiian tuna, they have fish roe included in the price and some non traditional topping such as the macaroni salad and mandarin oranges.

I love their Mac salad too which is like a creamy potato and Mac salad. They have so many sauces and toppings to choose from. I'm normally a salmon person but they rarely have spicy salmon or a more basic salmon poke but they're tuna is so good that I don't mind. I always go for the original. The staff and owner are super friendly too. I highly recommend this place.

They offered lots of complimentary toppings, and I especially loved the crab leg and the seaweeds. I chose spicy mayo and Japanese sauces, which went well with the poke. The fish was really fresh and came in large portion. I chose sushi rice for the base, which had a great texture. Good to enjoy the bowl seating on the seats along the window or add a lid to the bowl and take it out.

"592","150","A year later, still A+++++You honestly can't beat this price, value, and quality, especially for the area. (Hiroshi's is a much better deal than places like Ku Sushi despite their "always 50% off" deal. It's a gigantaur bowl for the price of a small roll or two and more variety of flavor.) Also, the sushi rice here is absolutely fantastic. I'm full Japanese, go back often, worked at a sushi restaurant, and am admittedly a bit of a snob when it comes to sushi. This is what it's supposed to be like, people. The poke is also fantastic. Flavorful, carefully marinated (unlike some Chipotle style places in the area). Everyone knows good poke is marinated. Boyfriend is also from Hawaii and he says Hiroshi has the best Mac salad he's ever had. That's a really high bar. It's extra but we always get a side of it.

There is so much flavor and food packed into this bowl and if you didn't think Poke was filling prior to trying this place your mind is immediately going to change. One thing to note, lomi lomi salmon is not alike other salmon poke!!! It's like, cooked? I actually had to do a little research before finishing this review so I could understand why the salmon tasted the way it did, so do not expect it to be like typical salmon poke. It was delicious nonetheless. Lastly, texture is superrr important in poke and I wish the fish had a little more structure instead of being a mushy mess.
