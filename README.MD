The Restaurant Industry - DATA

Overview | Problem Statement
The restaurant industry is a volatile industry, becoming harder and harder to both break into and maintain as rent, wages, and more increase. This problem affects both restaurant owners/employees, and patrons - rising costs are often offset by rising costs of food, which in turn, decreases demand. 
Failures of smaller, locally-owned restaurants have been an unfortunate, rising trend in big cities. On University Way, the turnaround rate is extremely fast. As of 2018, the turnover rate was a shocking 74.9% in the United States (restaurant.org). Considering this, restaurants need all the information they can get to succeed in the business, especially smaller restaurants that are at a major disadvantage compared to chain restaurants. 
For a locally-owned restaurant, there is so much data out there that can help improve business sales or provide insights into different marketing tactics. With knowledge of trends in the business space, smaller restaurants may have an edge to stay in business and compete.
