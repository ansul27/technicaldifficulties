        <p class="mx-3">
            To access the Yelp data, we scraped the website using Python, specifically the beautifulsoup package. We found the class names and HTML elements associated with
            the attributes we wished to record, and inputted these into the find functions used. First, we retrieved a list of all the restaurants in the U-District by scraping
            the "University District restaurants" search results paged. We also retrieved the individual Yelp URL for each of these restaurants so that we were able to access
            their individual pages as well, and subsequently get restaurant-specific information. The scraped data was then added to a SQL database hosted on Microsoft Azure
            using a number of SQL stored procedures. The stored procedures also added a number of computed columns in addition to the scraped attributes, such as hoursOpen
            and unique identifiers (described below).

        <h2 class="mx-3 mt-3 text-secondary">Database Implementation</h2>
        <p class="mx-3">
            A SQL database was used to store the data, which was normalized using five tables: restaurantData, resHours, restaurantCategories,
            categories, and reviews. <strong>restaurantData</strong> was the primary table of the database, and stored information that was
            essential to understand every other table. This included for each restaurant a unique identifier <em>resId</em>, the restaurant's name as <em>resName</em>,
            the total number of reviews for the restaurant as <em>numReviews</em>, the address as <em>resAddress</em>, a link to the restaurant's Yelp page as
            <em>yelpUrl</em>, and the overall rating for the restaurant as <em>rating</em>. resId was used to relate other tables to restaurantData.
            <br><br>
            The <strong>reviews</strong> table contained reviews from the first page of reviews of each restaurant. Each review had a unique
            identifier <em>reviewId</em>, the ID of the restaurant being reviewed as <em>resId</em>, the full text of the review as <em>review</em>,
            the rating given to the restaurant in that specific review as <em>stars</em>, and the date on which the review was written as <em>reviewDate</em>.
            Although we would have liked to record information about the user who wrote each individual review, we found that we were unable to access this
            information using beautifulsoup, as a search for its corresponding HTML element would return an "interface loading" object instead of the correct
            user information. We were unsure as to the cause of this error, and could not find a way to mitigate it despite attempts to add a loading buffer.
            <br><br>
            The table <strong>resHours</strong> contained information on the hours of operation of each restaurant. Each record contained an individual <em>hourId</em>,
            the ID of the restaurant which the hours applied to as <em>resId</em>, the day of the week which the hours were applicable to as <em>dayOfWeek</em>, the
            time the restaurant opened on that day as <em>openTime</em>, the time the restaurant closed on that day as <em>closeTime</em>, and the total hours the
            restaurant was open on that day, computed based on the opening and closing times, as <em>hoursOpen</em>. However, the information in this table contained
            some corruption since some restaurants would be open during multiple intervals during a day, in which case beautifulsoup was only able to access and store
            information for the first interval on any given day. This in turn corrupted the calculation of the total number of hours the restaurant was open for.
            Additionally, for any restaurant whose closing time was the next day, the calculation of the total number of hours open returned a negative number.
            <br><br>
            Finally, the <strong>categories</strong> table stored all the categories attributed to the restaurants in the restaurantData table. Each record contained a
            unique identifier <em>catId</em>, as well as the name of the category as <em>catName</em>. Instead of storing every category used by Yelp, we limited the table
            to records applicable to the restaurants recorded by adding categories as they were found on the individual restaurants' Yelp pages. The table
            <strong>restaurantCategories</strong> was an intermediary table linking restaurantData and categories to avoid duplicating records in the categories table. This
            table contained a unique <em>resCatID</em> for each record, a <em>resId</em> indicating the restaurant being referenced, and a <em>catId</em> indicating the
            category the restaurant was being mapped to.
