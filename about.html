        <h1 class="my-3 mx-3 text-center">About Our Project</h1>
        <h2 class="mx-3 mt-3 text-secondary">Methods and Design</h2>
        <p class="mx-3">
            To access the Yelp data, we scraped the website using Python, specifically the beautifulsoup package. We found the class names and HTML elements associated with
            the attributes we wished to record, and inputted these into the find functions used. First, we retrieved a list of all the restaurants in the U-District by scraping
            the "University District restaurants" search results paged. We also retrieved the individual Yelp URL for each of these restaurants so that we were able to access
            their individual pages as well, and subsequently get restaurant-specific information. The scraped data was then added to a SQL database hosted on Microsoft Azure
            using a number of SQL stored procedures. The stored procedures also added a number of computed columns in addition to the scraped attributes, such as hoursOpen
            and unique identifiers (described below).
        </p>
        <p class="mx-3">
            Tableau: we created visualizations on Tableau by directly connecting it to our Azure database. These images were used to determine the correlation, if any, between characteristics of restaurants and their ratings.
        </p>
        <p class="mx-3">
            We used multiple python libraries to preprocess our code and model the review system. We used natural language processing to pick out words that were prominent in a good and bad restaurant. These are the steps we took.
        </p>
        <p class="mx-3">
            Step 1: Import | Install packages and libraries. This allowed us to use functionality to remove stop words, create visualizations, use counters, and more.
        </p>
        <p class="mx-3">
            Step 2: Load Data
        </p>
        <p class="mx-3">
            Step 3: Clean the data using python module NLTK. Remove stopwords (unnecessary words)
        </p>
        <p class="mx-3">
            Step 4: Reload "cleaned reviews" into reviews json (new column). 
        </p>
        <p class="mx-3">
            Step 5: Determine if a review is "good" or "bad" based on ratings (0 is bad, 1 is good).
        </p>
         <p class="mx-3">
            Step 6: Split "good" and "bad" reviews. Determine most used word in good reviews versus bad reviews. Determine most used nouns in good reviews versus bad reviews.
        </p>
         <p class="mx-3">
            Step 7: Visualize most common words in word clouds. Remove unnecessary words. Re-run, and gather insights. 
        </p>
         <p class="mx-3">
            Step 8: Pick out words of interest and compare the number of times the word appears in good versus bad reviews.
        </p>
        <p class="mx-3"> 
            We then ran a model on it, the Multinomial Naive Bayes Classifer, to predict a rating by writing our own review.
        </p>
        <p class="mx-3">
            Step 1: Import | Install packages and libraries
        </p>
        <p class="mx-3">
            Step 2: Load and Organize Data. Remove stop words.
        </p>
        <p class="mx-3">
            Step 3: Replace 1, 2, 3 and 4 star reviews with 0 "bad" and 5 stars to 1 "good". This is to balance the number of good and bad reviews so the model works better (versus an unfair balance).
     We added a "Target" column that is the rating of the review. We counted the number of reviews (there are more 5 and 4 reviews than 1, 2 and 3 combined), so we classified into “good” and “bad” and reorganized it so there’s a more equal number, so the model works well on both good and bad, instead of being skewed one way.
        <p class="mx-3"> Step 4: Split data into train and test data</p>
        <p class="mx-3"> Multinomial Naive Bayes Classifier</p>
        <p class="mx-3"> Import and make pipeline </p>
        <p class="mx-3">Fit the model</p>
        <p class="mx-3"> Create a confusion matrix to visualize accuracy (true positive, true negative, false positive, false negative)</p>
        <p class="mx-3">Create a function to predict the rating of a review.</p>

        <h2 class="mx-3 mt-3 text-secondary">Database Implementation</h2>
        <p class="mx-3">
            A SQL database was used to store the data, which was normalized using five tables: restaurantData, resHours, restaurantCategories,
            categories, and reviews. <strong>restaurantData</strong> was the primary table of the database, and stored information that was
            essential to understand every other table. This included for each restaurant a unique identifier <em>resId</em>, the restaurant's name as <em>resName</em>,
            the total number of reviews for the restaurant as <em>numReviews</em>, the address as <em>resAddress</em>, a link to the restaurant's Yelp page as
            <em>yelpUrl</em>, and the overall rating for the restaurant as <em>rating</em>. resId was used to relate other tables to restaurantData.
            <br><br>
            The <strong>reviews</strong> table contained reviews from the first page of reviews of each restaurant. Each review had a unique
            identifier <em>reviewId</em>, the ID of the restaurant being reviewed as <em>resId</em>, the full text of the review as <em>review</em>,
            the rating given to the restaurant in that specific review as <em>stars</em>, and the date on which the review was written as <em>reviewDate</em>.
            Although we would have liked to record information about the user who wrote each individual review, we found that we were unable to access this
            information using beautifulsoup, as a search for its corresponding HTML element would return an "interface loading" object instead of the correct
            user information. We were unsure as to the cause of this error, and could not find a way to mitigate it despite attempts to add a loading buffer.
            <br><br>
            The table <strong>resHours</strong> contained information on the hours of operation of each restaurant. Each record contained an individual <em>hourId</em>,
            the ID of the restaurant which the hours applied to as <em>resId</em>, the day of the week which the hours were applicable to as <em>dayOfWeek</em>, the
            time the restaurant opened on that day as <em>openTime</em>, the time the restaurant closed on that day as <em>closeTime</em>, and the total hours the
            restaurant was open on that day, computed based on the opening and closing times, as <em>hoursOpen</em>. However, the information in this table contained
            some corruption since some restaurants would be open during multiple intervals during a day, in which case beautifulsoup was only able to access and store
            information for the first interval on any given day. This in turn corrupted the calculation of the total number of hours the restaurant was open for.
            Additionally, for any restaurant whose closing time was the next day, the calculation of the total number of hours open returned a negative number.
            <br><br>
            Finally, the <strong>categories</strong> table stored all the categories attributed to the restaurants in the restaurantData table. Each record contained a
            unique identifier <em>catId</em>, as well as the name of the category as <em>catName</em>. Instead of storing every category used by Yelp, we limited the table
            to records applicable to the restaurants recorded by adding categories as they were found on the individual restaurants' Yelp pages. The table
            <strong>restaurantCategories</strong> was an intermediary table linking restaurantData and categories to avoid duplicating records in the categories table. This
            table contained a unique <em>resCatID</em> for each record, a <em>resId</em> indicating the restaurant being referenced, and a <em>catId</em> indicating the
            category the restaurant was being mapped to.

        <ul>
            <li>
                User Information in a Script Tag, Hard to Retrieve
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        As we were scraping data from yelp.com we discovered that a lot of the data we wanted to process about users was actually displayed via a script tag, which meant we couldn’t access the info with Beautiful Soup. Ultimately we could collect some information from the user box in the actual review, but we weren’t able to collect all reviews from users with this method.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                Confusing, Inconsistent, and Too Many Class Names                
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        An example of the inconsistent class names would be “lemon--span__373c0__3997G” which is not common to the description of any other review on the same page, we ultimately had to rely on the order of tags within a review as opposed to a class name such as “reviewer-name”.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                Uploading to Azure IP Address Challenge
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Azure was not a common skill for all four of us on the team, and one of the hardest parts was getting everyone access to the database and even then, anytime one of us would move to a different wi-fi with a different IP address, we would have to manually add that IP address to the allowed IP addresses.                     
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                Finding Meaningful Relationships in Data
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        This was challenging because once we had successfully pulled all the information we wanted, it was disconcerting how little obvious relationship there was between say hours open and overall rating of restaurants on the Ave. Ultimately we had success seeing what types of words were most important in a review, such as location.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                Recaptcha
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        On an inconsistent basis, we would have to manually fill in a recaptcha for yelp.com in order to scrape data, so we would have to run our scrapedata.py script and then fill in the recaptcha puzzle before the script could stop working
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                Getting banned from Yelp
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        On one occasion Simran was attempting to pull data and had her IP address banned from yelp.com. This was a problem with many solutions, such as logging into a new wi-fi or another person scraping the data, but it added a lot of time to the data gathering process.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                Calculating Hours Open
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        One last challenge was an algorithmic problem, we originally calculated the hours open for each restaurant for each data as the absolute value of the difference between the closing and opening time, but when restaurants, particularly bars, would be open till the next day we had to consider that and add in hours accordingly.
                    </li>
