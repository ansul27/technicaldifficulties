Honestly I think the food is quite good, but not really any better than you could get at a mom and pop place.

The cucumber salad was so crisp and refreshing.From there, the food just kept coming and coming...For the buns and dumplings, the vegetarian dumplings were 10 heavenly pieces.

I feel spoiled with all the food I indulge with in my life. This place was delicious! Service was excellent, \u00a0I might add. Let's me break it down of what we ordered off the menu. FYI you order like you would at a dim sum restaurant. You just check off what you want off a food SCORE CARD I call it. Kurobuta Pork XioaLongBao dumpling - it was delightful with the hot broth inside the dumplingCrab & Pork XioaLongBao ( blue & snow crab) dumplings - pretty much the same as the first one but with crab in them. Also delightfulChicken fried rice - The color was light, not the same color as a normal fried rice would look but very delicious and flavorfulBraised beef soup - Beef was super tender with Bok Choy. It reminds me of a beef stew but in a Asian fushion type of way. Vegetarian noodle soup - which had mushroom Bok Choy with noodles. Was as little bland but hey what do you expect when it's vegetarian dish. Just add sauce to the broth to make it more flavorful. Vegetable & Kurobuto Pork Wonton with Spicy Sauce - this was prob one of my favorites. It packed so much flavor. It was not that spicy which was good for me. Definitely recommend it. Sweet and Sour Pork Baby Back Ribs - this was another one of my favorite which you must get. Little sweet but not overwhelming. Cucumber salad - This is a must. It reminds me of the kimji cucumber except these ones are a lot thicker. If gives you a nice crunch for texture. Shredded Kurobuto Pork Fried Rice - They make the noodles fresh and from scratch so you already know it's going to be super good.

Yes, most of their dishes have the Kurobuta Pork in it but trust me they are all delicious! In my opinion, my most favorite dish out of everything is the Wontons with spicy Sauce! The wonton is packed with great flavor from the two types of protein that is in the mix and the sauce that is swimming in just makes everything turn into a perfect picture! \u00a0Lastly, their menu is pretty big with other stuff that is also gluten free or vegetarian so that those who are any of those two can enjoy a meal too!

And I will be going back to Bugis!ATMOSPHEREThe place is really big with adequate seating. It looks kind of small from the outside but I was shocked by how big it actually was! The tables were spaced out nicely so that you don't feel crammed like a can of sardines. My favorite aspect of this location are the big windows. If you read my reviews, I always rave about places having natural light. It's also very clean!WHAT DID WE TRY?We had their seafood okonomiyaki. Going in, I had pretty high expectations because I've had homemade okonmiyaki while visiting Asia. This place was pretty good though! I really liked the crunchiness of the outside while keeping the inside soft and moist. There was a proportionate amount of sauce that did not overpower the main dish which I appreciated! The dish itself was pretty heavy so if you order it, I would order something light and acidic to balance out the dish. We also tried their spicy mayo tofu bowl. The bowl came with fresh greens, corn, rice, fried tofu marinated in a spicy sauce, pickled veggies, and a boiled egg. Personally, I found the dish pretty spicy despite having a pretty high spice tolerance. Thank goodness there were other aspects of the bowl that were able to balance out the spicy tofu. A couple things that I noticed were that the coating for the tofu was pretty thick which left the inside of the tofu pretty dense. I personally like tofu to be a little fluffier when it's fried. However this was not a super big deal because it was still delicious. Another thing was that the rice got kind of soggy due to the sauce. Overall, I would still order this bowl again because the sauce was something I found really unique. I can't really describe the tase but it left a good and lasting impression on me.

When the sign went up and news spread that this place was opening up in my city, we immediately made reservations about a month in advance in great anticipation. By far, Bamboo Sushi is some of the best sushi between the two cities. I have gone to every location in Portland numerous times and have always enjoyed my time there.Unfortunately, Bamboo Sushi - Seattle, you have truly let us down. The first thing that set the tone of our evening the wrong way was when we came about 10 min before our reservation and saw many empty tables. Yet we still had to wait until exactly our reservation time to get seated. While the hostess said asked us to wait a few minutes for them to set the table, it seemed to take much longer than what was said.Second strike happened when my plate was dirtied by some old food scraps and my glass was stained all around. My whole dining set just didn't look clean, but all the other plates and glasses were fine. They immediately replaced everything (saved yourselves there).Third strike was when our first waiter (yes there was a waiter switch with no warning) brought us the edamame for the table but the edamame appeared to be 3\/4 already eaten. Usually, the box is a bit overflowing with fresh, bright green edamame. Our box tonight had maybe 8 small-medium pieces total with a few brown spots here and there...and not a bright green color.Fourth strike took place when our cauliflower appetizer came out after 2 of our main dishes came out ahead of it. Thank goodness we were getting food coming to our table, but the timing just seemed off. And not to mention, the description mentions a black bean sauce. This dish reminded me of some frozen fake chicken bbq tenders. No hint of the black bean. Flavor was not doing it for us. Texture was off. Definitely not what we expected from the order.Fifth strike was when it took a little over an hour for our green machine w\/ albacore to come out. Even though, we saw a table that got seated way after us get a green machine with albacore as a \"surprise\" roll for being first timers. We literally waited an hour after they got that roll for us to get ours. And what's even worse is when we did, my friend took a bite of one piece and immediately told me not to eat it. She's had this dish MANY times in the Portland locations, and this was a taste\/texture moment that could not be erased. She said it was like eating into a mealy apple. And when you touched the roll, your whole finger or chopstick just sank in. We asked to take the roll back and the sushi chef told a waiter to insist that this is how the roll has always been made (as she's been at the Portland locations). In fact, when they came back to tell us the roll was indeed fine, it almost felt that we were getting blamed for not liking the roll as they insisted that this was how it's always been made. Honestly, it felt like they mashed up day old tuna and scraped it up to put it on our roll. Not appetizing, and definitely not how it's prepared in their Portland locations. The staff said that they would bring us a regular green machine instead.30 minutes later....and the manager coming to apologize on the wait and saying this roll was on the house, we finally got the last roll. It was unfortunate that they ended up charging us for the roll even though we were told otherwise. Sixth strike?Seventh strike was when our waiter gave us our receipt and the green machine w\/ albacore was charged not only once but twice. Remember, this was the roll that was taken back immediately. And when we mentioned it to the waiter, he came back and the receipt had the roll taken off but the reason was \"wait too long\". Definitely not the case.

And touched roll, whole finger chopstick sank in. We asked take roll back sushi chef told waiter insist roll always made (as Portland locations). In fact, came back tell us roll indeed fine, almost felt getting blamed liking roll insisted always made. Honestly, felt like mashed day old tuna scraped put roll. Not appetizing, definitely prepared Portland locations. The staff said would bring us regular green machine instead.30 minutes later....and manager coming apologize wait saying roll house, finally got last roll.

I ordered Chi Mac for delivery through Caviar, and the food was decent. I ordered a medium sized Snow wings, and a small sized Sichuan Pepper wings. The snow wings were okay. I decided to order the medium size since all of my friends rave about them, and I can see that they're a fan favorite here on Yelp. Personally, I wasn't a huge fan of them. The seasoning was way too over powering, and I can't imagine if they were dusted as much as shown in their product image. The wings had a really nice crisp to them which I enjoyed, but a majority of them were really dry on the inside. After 3-4 wings, I got tired of the flavor. You can recreate these wings at home yourself. Just fry up some wings, and douse them with garlic and onion powder (which is what their Snow wings are dusted in). I don't know why everybody raves about these wings. They're way too onion-y in my opinion. Maybe if they cut down on the seasoning, it would be a bit more bearable. The Sichuan Pepper wings are phenomenal though! I regretted ordering the Snow in a size medium, and the Sichuan Pepper in a small. The Sichuan Pepper wings had more going for them flavor wise. You can taste a whole bunch of Chinese spices, and the taste wasn't over powering like the Snow wings. I wanted to try their fried rice, but I couldn't justify paying $11 for a boat sized portion of fried rice. You can get an entree portion of fried rice for that price at plenty of other Asian restaurants in the surrounding area. When my order arrived, they didn't close the takeout box all of the way so that the wings didn't get soggy during delivery. I really appreciated it, and I thought that it was an extremely smart idea. For some reason, they only have the Korean wings, Snow wings, Pride Chicken, Fried Rice, and Fries available for order on Caviar. I wish they had their entire menu listed to order, but I wouldn't mind popping into the establishment sometime. Overall, I wish that I could give this place 4-5 stars. I paid $24.22 not including Caviar's service fee, and delivery tip. $24 for wings that are dry is just unfortunate.

Chi Mac serves Korean Style chicken wings with several different flavors. Food: The chicken here come out extremely hot and flavorful. When you bite into the chicken, you can still see the moisture and steam coming from the chicken wing itself. They have several different flavors with snow wings being a must try. Their corn cheese is also a must try, but I do have a weakness from corn covered in cheese. One of my favorite things to order here is actually the pride chicken. The pride chicken is an entire chicken cut up into large pieces with an entire pride chicken consisting of about 8 pieces. The pride chicken packs a lot of flavor for a good price and you're able to buy additional dipping flavoring that traditionally comes on the wing. The breading on the pride chicken is really crispy and the chicken is fried very well.Service: Their service is what knocks it down for me. At times, you can go in and get a meal in a fair amount of times, but sometimes it can take forever to get your wings.

Doesn't look like they clean the table right after the people leave or if they were just busy because when we were seated they had to wipe down the table first. The menu is pretty limited only having chicken, drinks, fries and cheese corn. My mom and I both ordered the small 7 pc Soy Garlic Wings ($9\/ each), the Corn Cheese ($11), and the French Fries ($5).

The first time, I got Korean Wings and Cheese Corn. The second time, I wasn't in the wings mood, so I got Fried Rice and Cheese Corn. My friends split an order of 75 naked wings though. The Korean Wings are marinated in spicy red Korean chili sauce. Koreans like their foods fiery hot, and this dish is no exception. The Korean wings are definitely hot and spicy and are not for the weak-hearted. However, they are super crispy, sweet, and sticky- the stuff that makes wings so good and addicting. I haven't tried the other flavors yet, but my friends tend to like either the snow wings or the naked wings with an assortment of sauces. Yes, I ordered cheese corn ($11) both times here. I can't say it's the best thing I've ever eaten in my life, but it is a good palette cleanser. The corn is really sweet, but corn is basically just sugar so that's to be expected. I wish that they put more melted cheese\/sauce on it. I feel like the ratio could be better because I end up eating just plain baked corn half way through.The fried rice was decent, but overpriced for $11. It had egg, cherry tomatoes, chinese sausage, and scallions. It was crispy and had a strong sesame oil taste. I probably wouldn't order it again, but it's a good option if you want something other than wings.This probably goes without saying, but this is not the place you go on a first date on. I can assure you that red sauce will get everywhere no matter how hard you try. Eat them when you're hanging with your buddies because there's no way to attractively eat wings. Also, they tend to blast the music so it can be pretty hard to carry on a conversation.I would give this place 4\/5 stars, but service both times has been extremely slow. Today, I waited half an hour for a table and about another half an hour for my corn cheese. They also forgot about my fried rice, so I just asked the waiter to get it to-go. They usually only have two waiters\/cashiers and it looks like one or two cooks in the back. Additionally, they still have yet to renew their liquor license, so it's really just chi (chicken) without mac (beer).

It's like this restaurant is never empty and there's a constant rotation of people coming in and leaving - which is great for business but is it worth the type? \u00a0Parking was easy to find in the middle of the day, plus the farmer's market was going on until 2pm down the street which was cute to walk off the carbs afterwards.When you first walk in, don't expect to be served right away - there's literally a sign that says you have to order at the front; grab a menu and help yourself to a seat. \u00a0Since we've never been here before, my bf and I ordered their garlic cucumbers, the cumin lamb noodle in soup and the pulled pork noodles (not in soup) to try out their handpulled noodles. \u00a0Food came out quickly and they serve you at the table with a number. The garlic cucumbers were SO GOOD! I loved these - but then again, you can't really screw these up and they are quite standard at a lot of Chinese restaurants. The pulled pork noodles were more flavorful than I thought it would be since there's no chili oil all over it. \u00a0The broth was good, pork was good... noodles were THICK! Like... there's quite a lot of inconsistency between each strand or noodle so you can be taking giant bites off and it's quite chewy. \u00a0My bf got the cumin lamb spicy noodle in soup and he liked it - not VERY spicy (my spice tolerance is low and even I could manage it) AND he drank all the soup! I think he enjoyed it but it probably upset his stomach a bit to eat all the spice at once. Plus there's a good pool of oil when you get it so it's quite shiny.Overall, $30 lunch for the two of us and the portion sizes were large ($10 per noodle bowl and I think that's a great price for Seattle!). \u00a0They have a hot pot station too to make your own which we didn't try but maybe next time! Next to the hot pot station is a sauces station and I used that. There's a variety of EVERYTHING and I love how easy it was; reminds me a lot of China there. \u00a0My bf is also allergic to peanuts and I can safely say - he lived! So for anyone else worried about severe allergies to peanuts, I think you're good. \u00a0I took off one star because it's not exactly the prettiest restaurant but very efficient (there's even a woman that cleans the tables RIGHT after you leave and if you loiter too long, she shoos you away to make room for other people); very high turnover. \u00a0And I took off another star because I mean - it's tasty food but not TO DIE FOR (somewhat oily) and not worth going out of your way for... unless I'm in the university area (which I'll never go on a Saturday during football game time again - hint: traffic is HORRENDOUS when you're leaving haha).","11\/6\/2019",116,3,"I hearing lot great things Xi'an Noodles I finally decided make trip grab lunch.

You can add garlic, green onions, chili oil, etc to your heart's desire with their \"spice bar\", and who doesn't love customization?The place isn't anything fancy with tables put together and taken apart to accommodate different sized parties, and it's not unlikely to basically share a table with another party.

Spicy cumin lamb hand-ripped noodle - #1 on their menu and probably the most popular one because it's just so good. I love the classic combination of cumin and lamb, and the spiciness adds more flavor to the noodle. Their noodle are all made by hand so it's wide and chewy, and hard to find in other places. For this dish, however, because it's so popular, they tend to make a lot in advance so you might get a slightly cold one that was made even before you order it. Malatang - aka making your own mini hotpot. This type of dish is not that well-known but I often order it here because not many restaurants offer this. They let you choose how to cook it (spiciness level, with or without soup), and charge you by pound. I recommend to choose the one with meat as the prices don't differ that much with or without meat. Most of the things you can choose from are fresh. There aren't that many but it's good enough for me. Stewed pork hand-ripped noodle - go for this one if you can't eat spicy food at all! I love the flavor of the pork because you can tell they put lots of Chinese spices in it and stew it for really long. I always put more sauce in it (btw love their sauce bar) as this one is a little bit lack of flavor to me. Their paomo, cold noodle, cold dishes, lamb dumplings are also pretty good.

I came here around 6pm on a Saturday and ordered their cumin lamb noodles in soup, while my girlfriend ordered the non-spicy option with pork. A good bowl of Biang Biang noodles are supposed to have a good balance of \"slurpiness\" and chewiness without getting sticky. While the noodles themselves were quite good (not too thick, not too soft, not too chewy), I wasn't as impressed with the lamb and broth in my noodle soup. The broth was a lot thinner than I expected and tasted a little watered down (my guess is that they just take the dry noodles and add broth).

The endives had somehow made everything in the salad really bitter including the shaved carrot. Very strange. Definitely a flavor fail.For my main I had the pumpkin gnocchi which was generally pretty good though undersalted (which is not something I normally complain about).So overall didn't love my meal and my husband felt similarly about his meal.

Came in for dinner on a Friday night a few weeks back. Kind of late, around 8:30 so it wasn't too busy. D\u00e9cor is cute. I like that they've brightened the place up from the previous Lucia vide. Initial greeting from the hostess was friendly and we were seated promptly (had a reservation). My overall feeling on this place is that it has good potential and a lot of room to grow. The menu reflects a well thought out approach but some of the flavors in the dishes just didn't quite make sense for me. I love simple, I love complex, I love great food. But if you're going to attempt to elevate your menu with more complexity, you need to do it right. If the components in the dish don't jive, its just an over complicated plate which wasn't well executed. We ordered 2 appetizers, 2 entrees and dessert. Food reviews as follows:Seared Calamari - Not your typical, which was exciting. This was calamari stuffed with chorizo. That part was good! I enjoyed the flavor combo. The accompaniments however (carrot puree, mint), didn't seem to pair well in my opinion. Room for improvement. Black Cod Ceviche - Enjoyed this, fish was fresh and it did have an overall \"bright\" theme to the dish. Some of the pickled items and the overuse of mint didn't quite make sense with the other items but I understand the direction they were going in. Duck Breast - Gahhh. Was so on the fence with this dish. I wanted to love it because the duck was actually cooked perfectly. The skin, my fav was on point but it was way over salted :( and I can handle salt, love salt but even this was a little much for me. The rest of the dish was good overall, nothing which made me scream wow, but nice texture combos with the wild rice and the mostarda and decent depth of flavor. Hanger Steak - Best part of this dish was the sunchokes. Steak and chimichurri were underwhelming and under seasoned. Maybe just not the spot for steak. Olive Oil Brownie - Im a sucker for dessert! and I love olive oil anything. The server sold us on this, indicating that the olive oil kept the brownie super moist, almost gooey. Uh, not the case. This baby was dry. But luckily the sweet cream ice cream was delightful and gave the brownie some moisture assistance. This was a tough review to right because at first glance I think this place should be 5 stars and I can appreciate the creative dishes their going for. Just didn't feel the value was there at this time. I do think i'll give this place another try (and hopefully update my review) as they do serve brunch and i'm always down for a great brunch.

It's a real gem. It's nice to have something a little more elevated in the Greenlake area! Some dishes I highly recommend are the Venison + Pork Sausage, the Honey Glazed Half Smoked Chicken, the local lettuces (such a perfect yet simple salad to pair with anything you order!) and you can't go wrong with the oysters- very fresh and perfectly chilled. The hangar steak and crab salad was just OK to me- I felt like my steak was pretty tough to chew and didn't seem like it was salted let alone seasoned. Beautiful presentation nevertheless.Their wine selection is alright. I believe there was only one option by the glass for each type of wine which is fine- but I'd be pleased if they rotate or swap those out because the Cabernet Sauvignon option they offered didn't wow me. Their Rozella drink is delicious if you're in the mood for something fruity. It's just the right amount of sweet\/tart\/refreshing\/satisfying. The Bellini at brunch is great too!If you're there for brunch I suggest the Horchata Pain Perdu for something sweet- it's amazing! Tip: split it with someone. It's massive and even half of it left me feeling quite indulged. The fried oyster hash is also good and a very unique dish at that! Loved both. Can't wait to try more brunch items!I've always had pretty great service here. The staff is polite and professional and you can tell they believe in the food and the chef. The space is bright and clean, it could even stand to be a little more dimly lit in the \u00a0evenings in my opinion but that's no reason to complain.

I ordered 50% sugar time case friend ordered 100% I think. Mine tasted like 100% like 1000%. So please adjust sweetness. The surf turf MalaTang pretty good, I ordered spicy time, crazily spicy, right amount spicy me, I add chili oil, oh I mention chili oil! It's really good flavorful! Garlic pork belly rice okay, reason pork littler watery, I wish would garlic since said mashed garlic (??) garlic meat, I could taste hint garlic, rice meat good I like mix malatang soup it. Overall I would say good! 7\/10 The drinks need improved!!",1.0],[9,"Upon hearing a lot of hype, from my Taiwanese friends, I had to give this spot a try. I came ona sunday right when they opened and it didnt take long for the restaurant to fill up. I did see a fair bit of other asian customers, \u00a0so this is a good initial sign the food is going to be good and authentic. The service is a tad slow, but just flag down the servers if you need anything instead of expecting them to check on you (nothing out of the ordinary for Asian restaurants).For being in the freemont area, the prices are fair for what you get. The portions are good while not being overly expensive: $11-15 an entree. I tried a variety of the dishes and it looks like basic fare: a combination of soups, simple rice dishes paired with a protein, a side and sauces, \u00a0and various street foods for appetizers. Beef noodle soup 5\/5 - very well done, with a great balancing of flavors while not getting too heavy. Reminds me of what I actually got in taiwan!Mala dumps 4\/5 - these were good, and the broth was super flavorful with lots of the mala kick! Unfortunately the dumplings were nothing crazy but they were good either way!Crispy turnip cake 5\/5 - light, oily, \u00a0soft on the inside and crispy on the outside, served with a garlic soy crack sauce. Scallion pancakes 5\/5 - light, crispy, and fluffy with many layers. Couldn't have done this any better, and also served with the garlic soy crack sauce. Twice roasted milk tea 4\/5 - although this was good, it didnt blow my mind. At least the boba was cooked to the wrong consistency!Overall, I enjoyed my experience here without killing my wallet! I wouldn't come back again in the near future as I'd prefer to explore other spots, but I'd highly recommend checking it out at least once!","11\/13\/2019",156,4,"Upon hearing lot hype, Taiwanese friends, I give spot try.

Ok ok, not everything was perfect, but the things that were good were absolutely fantastic. I love Taiwanese food. I lived in Taiwan for 3 months and all I did was eat, eat, and eat. Now I can do the same in Seattle. Good luck to this laowai and his poor stomach. We went for happy hour, which is essentially $1 off an extensive list of appetizers and some beers. Most things were good, some things were great and others were excellent. QQ Milk Tea - got 80% sweetness as per the server's recommendation but think regular would have been fine too. The tea was very flavorful. The boba were a little too chewy but nothing too upsetting as it was consistent. Overall a very good milk tea, especially for a non specialized boba store! Garlic green beans - these were good but nothing special. They were fresh and balanced some of the other greasier fried foods that we ordered. Scallion Pancake (??????) - I dare say that this was the best green onion pancake that I have ever had outside of China or Taiwan. The dough was perfectly oily, crispy and flakey. The addition of a fried egg is rare to come by and elevated this simple dish even further. The accompanying dipping sauce was a sweet, garlic soy which was divine. I'll be back just for this. 19 GOLD Fries - great hangover food of popcorn chicken over fries served with three sauces - ketchup, mustard, and condensed milk (???). Kinda weird but kinda great. Got the sauces on the side. The chicken was flavorful and tender, but could have been a tad crispier. Braised Duck Wings - something I've never encountered before but now I'm hooked. Big portion for the price. I asked the waiter how these are cooked as they were sweet from soy braising but also slightly crunchy like chicken wings. Turns out they deep fry these bad boys just before serving. So much yum -- a must order! Lamb Malatang - we opted for the extra rich broth which was honestly fantastic. However, it came warm and not hot probably due to the frozen toppings being added in. The waiter promptly corrected this by heating it up. The dish felt a little light on the toppings so I may try something else soup based next time. You get unlimited rice but we had so much other food that we didn't need a refill. Fried buns with condensed milk - Like any good relationship, there is always something that let's you down, but you put up with it for the greater good. These buns were just that. They were far too oily and heavy to eat more than one or two. These are meant to be soft in the inside and break apart like a mantou, not extra crispy like some kind of deep fried churro. Either they were cut too skinny before frying or the consistency of their dough is off. Hoping they fix these as I love myself some sweet buns. Overall a great dining experience with fantastic, attentive service, delicious food, and a great variety of menu options. I will certainly be back for more GOLD(en scallion pancake).

A little on the bland side but I don't mind as you can always add a little salt. Green Onion Pancake:Dare I say the best green onion pancake I've had. We added egg on it which was a great addition. The pancake was so crispy and flaky yet still soft in the middle. The dipping sauce that accompanied was a good balance of sweet and savory. Braised Duck Wings:Tons of flavor and great texture. A rather big portion too. The waiter says it is braised then fried right before serving. 19 Gold Fries:Basically popcorn chicken and fries with 3 sauces. We opted for sauce on the side which I recommend if you don't like your fries messy. The chicken was nice and crispy. One of the sauces served with it was condensed milk which I thought was weird but was surprisingly good.

The place is pretty tiny. We ordered the onion pancake and popcorn chicken to start - they were both delicious! The pancake was the crispiest version of this dish that I've ever had. It was flavorful and not too greasy. The popcorn chicken was super crispy and the coating was seasoned well. I would definitely order both of those items again.My boyfriend and I shared the house special Mala tang. You get to customize this dish with your choice of broth, level of spiciness, protein choice, and side option (vermicelli or rice). We got the regular broth, but they also have a spicy version and a super rich version that has milk in it. We went with a low spice level and beef as our protein. The house special dish comes with tons of stuff including lotus root, tofu, tofu skin, fish cake, lobster ball, quail egg, broccoli, corn, enoki mushroom, crab stick, and other things!

Where else can you get a large pork belly rice bowl for $5 in Seattle? As of the date I wrote this review, they also offer free pork refills for your bowl! Where does any other restaurant in Seattle do that?? So delicious. They also have pretty great boba milk tea. Plus, they're so close to where I reside. I'm sold! Located in the heart of Fremont, it's a great location for their business. They also have patio seating, which is nice for the warmer weathers here in Seattle. They have plenty of taiwanese snacks and I have tried a couple so far, including their popcorn chicken\/19 gold fries, deep fried golden buns, taiwanese braised combo platter. For their entrees, I have tried the malatang house special, malatang soup dumplings, and pork belly\/minced pork over rice. Everything was solid. They also have kid friendly options, including a rice plate on a car shaped tray, which is super adorable! So if you have kids, I'm sure they can enjoy this place too.As for the milk teas, they definitely sweetened them far lower than the normal standard. I'm a person that usually gets 30-50% sugar level for my milk teas at other locations, but the way they make it is already significantly reduced in sugar. When I got jasmine milk tea and yogurt green tea at 30%, it literally taste like there was 0% sugar in both lol. So if you like some sweetener in your milk tea, I recommend starting at 50-70% then judge from there if you would reduce it some more or not. Otherwise, the milk tea and boba is great! I recommend the Japanese twice-roasted milk tea and jasmine milk tea.

I'm gluten-free and I greatly appreciate the several gluten-free options on the menu and the fact that I've never flared with my medical condition after eating here (gluten has the potential to cause a painful flare for me), however, the gluten-free toast tastes awful - bland, with a displeasing texture - so I almost always decline it.The ambiance is not great either - not much thought put into chairs, tables, vibe, or decor.All that being said, I'm a regular because what they do right, I really love. The farmer's hash is incredible - especially with the salmon added to it.The migas (which they can serve gluten-free, minus the tortillas) are extremely tasty, incredibly filling, and deeply satisfying.The huevos rancheros are well above average, as long as you compare them to other Seattle offerings of the same dish, rather than comparing them to huevos rancheros meals at restaurants in Texas or Southern California.The dungeness crab omelet is to-die-for.

The Cumin Chicken was pretty crispy, but the ratio of batter to the actual chicken is off. Too much flour while less chicken for a whole plate of basically chicken tempura (fried in batter). Plus, there is barely anything cumin taste in the chicken and no dipping sauce on the side. I had to ask for some ketchup because I am pretty sure they won't have sweet and sour. For a dish that costs 14 bucks, I would say it is not really worth it. My friend and I did not even bother to finish it, because it got kinda boring after a few bits. On the other hand, the Shredded Potato with Jalapeno is pretty authentic and good. Don't worry about it being spicy because of the Jalapeno, it is not spicy at all.

Everything was served fresh and you could tell they used fresh ingredients. The mapo tofu was delicious with a kind of floral taste to it that you usually don't get at other places. The eggplant with garlic sauce was incredible as well. The eggplant has a slight crust on it and the garlic sauce really enhanced the flavors.

She didn't seem to care much anyways though. However, when we had her again on Friday and her attitude and general lack of knowledge was debatably worse honestly, we just kind of wanted to leave.

Plus when we got there, we were informed that it was happy hour until closing that night (and Saturday), so we went to sit at the bar area for the happy hour. The lighting here is quite dim giving an intimate\/romantic ambience. The setup in the dining area was specially romantic with the classic chandelier and all. I really like the interior here.The service wasn't the greatest which was apparent the moment we stepped in and not greeted with the slightest smile both from the hostess and the waitress. But I did find that she was quite attentive in checking on us.We ordered Spaghetti al' ortolano which has grape tomatoes, pine nuts, big chunks of goat cheese and rucola. I don't usually care for goat cheese but this meal was enjoyable thoroughly specially with the crunch from the pine nuts as well, the flavor was very light though. We also ordered the Melina pizza which is the black truffle pizza with mushroom and mozzarella. This one is yum! The black truffle is very prominent. It reminded us with the NYC black truffle pizza that we had (that went viral before), minus the oozing egg.For drink we got X-rated Tini (mango, passionfruit liqueur with sky blood orange soda) and Plum Blossom (pearl plum vodka, lemon juice and triple sec). Both drinks were very very good. The X-rated Tini is more a citrusy refreshing cocktail, while the Plum Blossom reminds me a lot of a cotton candy type of cocktail. I was pleased with the food and drink. Probably would order their eggplant parmigiana and their risotto next time. For dessert, we were hoping to order their cannoli but the waitress told us that they hadn't made it in a long time so we got their Tiramisu. The tiramisu sadly is pretty standard. Our bill came to about $60 excluding tax. Overall, for the portion and quality, I do find the price to be overpriced.

Combo comes with a huge fruit soda. I ordered a mango soda. I like that they use real fruit in it and it's not too sweet. The design of the cup is probably the USP of this business. If they tried just a little with their marketing, I'm sure a bunch of people would want to visit just for the cup. It's very gram-worthy. We sat next to the window and people were definitely paying attention to it. Some even decided to stop by and have lunch. (Concept: what if the soda is boba instead. Take notes, Oasis.)- Soy sauce pork: Pork's quality is inconsistent. Some pieces are really dry, but some are okay. Overall, the pork itself is not marinated well. It's pretty bland inside. I wouldn't order it in the future.- Soy sauce wings: ordered it thinking we would not be full with the two above, but turns out that was not the case. Wings are cheaper than Chi Mac's, but not as flavorful. I might come back for the wings, just because it's cheaper and closer than Chi Mac.- Fries & pickles: they come with the order. I'm not a fan. Fries are not crispy and some are even hollow. I just don't like pickles, and I don't see the point of having them with those fried chickens. Would rather have Korean pickled radish instead. - Service: there's not much service involved, but people helping us were pleasant.

This is probably the best Korean shaved ice I've had besides Korea. There are so many places that try to mimic this... but this is by far the most rememberable.

In summary, I gave this place 4 stars because the flavor of their bingsoos are unique, they have a fantastic discount, and their employees are welcoming. I docked one star down because it can feel cramped.ATMOSPHEREThis place is always packed with people so it does tend to get loud and crowded. As a result, it can be hard to hear the person next to you or sit comfortably without bumping into the table next you. However, despite that, it is a very welcoming and clean space. There are plants decorated throughout. They also have big windows to let in lots of natural light but they also have white fluorescent lights which makes it perfect for taking pictures! They also have the place set up to allow customers to watch how the taiyaki is made. WHAT DID WE TRY?I've been to Snowy many times so I've had the opportunity to try quite a few items on their menu (strawberry bingsoo, watermelon, mango bingsoo, Nutella taiyaki, cheese taiyaki, and red bean taiyaki). My favorite is the watermelon bingsoo. Never have I seen someone serve bingsoo in a melon, but that is how it's done here at Snowy. The bingsoo itself is covered in a layer of melon balls with a drizzle of condensed milk. The snow itself is as soft freshly fallen snow. When you take a bite into it, it instantly melts into a sweet cream. For the taiyakis, I honestly like all of them. They are classic flavors that nobody can really hate. Their dough is pretty much like a croissant which \u00a0makes the taiyaki crunchy yet slightly gluttonous and chewy. For the filling, they are not stingy at all! I often find myself taking some of it out because it can get too sweet for me. Despite liking all their flavors, the red bean stood out to me the most because their filling has little red bean chunks in it. I personally really like it when certain foods have chunks in it because it makes it feel less processed. It also gives it a layer of depth to the filling. It also helps to not make the filling feel like mushy. CUSTOMER SERVICEBecause this place is really popular, you may expect to wait up to 30 minutes to be seated during rush hour. However, despite this, the employees are always smiling and friendly. I've even had the boss come up to ask me if everything was going fine and if I had any recommendations for the place. Initially, I was taken aback because this rarely ever happens to me. It was nice to talk to her though and it made me feel like the staff actually cares about the quality and experiences of their customers.

My to-go combo is garlic flavour, lamb and mild spiciness. Super flavourful and lots of meat and veggies. Btw, every time you ask for something higher than \"very mild,\" the waitress is going to ask you if you're sure because their definition of spicy is real spicy and she's not kidding! You've been warned.I've tried quite a few of other dishes. The puff pastry seafood soup is very tasty, but there is not much content in the soup. The backed spaghetti choices don't come with as much cheese as I would have liked. The malatang's flavour is watered down by the broth - definitely go with the dry pot if you're feeling something spicy. I love the egg drop soup, and it does come with certain dishes, so ask about that.

I made reservations for restaurant week on a Thursday at 6 pm. Parking wasn't too bad. The neighborhoods around have some street parking around, especially since it was an early Thursday night. When we got in, the place was already pretty packed. It's not a big place, I would highly recommend reservations as other reviewers have already mentioned. We were seated pretty quickly, and they took our jackets, which was a nice touch. We ordered from the restaurant week menu. I started with the green salad, main entree was the brisket with duck fat potatoes, and for dessert the banana bread pudding. Boyfriend got the asparagus soup, the risotto, and the banana bread pudding as well. We also decided to get the pickle tray to start. Boyfriend also got an Old Fashion while I decided on a Tequila Sunrise. The drinks were good. I'm a huge fan of tequila, and they did a good job with putting in a good amount of tequila where I could still taste it yet it wasn't overpowering. The food came out at a good time, the waiter who brought out our food knew when we were done and would quickly clear our plates and bring out our next course.The bread they brought out beforehand was good, pretty standard. The pickle tray was a little laughable. It was a small bowl of just a couple of pickle things. Really not worth it. It was a bit of a let down. The pickles were okay, nothing memorable. I liked the green salad with the chevre toast. The dressing was light, and the chevre toast paired well with the salad. My boyfriend's asparagus soup was light and springy. My brisket was good, again, pretty standard. Nothing too memorable. I wasn't a huge fan of my boyfriends risotto, but he liked it. I thought it lacked flavor although it was cooked well. We were both let down by the banana bread pudding. They didnt put enough custard all over the banana bread, so the corners were just dried out banana bread. It was crunchy and kind of ruined it for us. Service is quick and efficient. Although when we left, nobody gave us our jackets, so we just grabbed them from the coat rack with all the other coats ourselves. It's a cute, trendy place. Food was honestly just average for me.

And a menu, unless redactions or conditions are listed on it, means all items are available for consumption at the time of the visit. Today, I walked away from one of my favorite Hawaiian\/Japanese\/Korean\/Chinese restaurants in the U-District - Itadakimasu. It was after numerous instances of degrading customer service. Pro: Inexpensive, bountiful portions, a diverse menu of both Hawaiian, Japanese, Korean, and Asian menu items, a full bar featuring cocktails and local and international beer. Cons. Inept servers, pre-cooked Chicken teriyaki, slow service based on menu item ordered, the unprepared kitchen staff at the opening, overall poor attention to customer needs. Example No. 1. As a regular, I stopped in and ordered the Musubi paying careful attention to asking that it be delivered before my meal. After waiting for around 12 minutes, both my Musubi and order arrived at the same time. Upon letting them know I had specifically asked for the Musubi before my meal they protested and indicated the Musubi is made to order and the kitchen didn't pay attention to the order beyond the items. I protested but ended up paying for the Musubi. Overall, the meal was as always great while the customer service refused to take ownership of their mistake. Example No. 2. During another visit, I stopped in and was prepared to order a half order of chicken breast teriyaki. Initially, I was seated, before the server returned to the POS (point of sale) station and proceeded to answer and record an order, followed by losing themselves in their phone. After around 10 minutes of patiently waiting, it wasn't until new customers arrived that I received service. Worse still my order ended up appearing after the newly arrived customers' (who ordered regular Chicken Teriyaki). Example No. 3. Today, after walking through the door, paying careful attention both the time and the Open sign turned on, walked in and grabbed a menu before telling the server my order - a Chicken Breast Teriyaki half order. The server returned shortly after taking a two-top's order, that despite being open their grill wasn't ready for a chicken breast order. Let me be clear, they did not offer any alternative or inform me of the wait. They just stood there, apologetic but offered no reassurance. Needless to say, I'm probably not going back for a while. To be clear, the majority of my experiences have been mostly good. The teriyaki tastes fresh (albeit on occasion burnt around the edges), the Mochiko is solid, and the option to sub brown rice is great. But lately, the quality of service has been horrible associated with everything from food arriving separately to this latest setback (associated with a poorly-prepared kitchen). Also, let me reiterate that this restaurant has some of the best cost to quantity ratios of any Japanese teriyaki restaurant in the U-District. In fact, on average you receive around 13 ounces of chicken. 13! \u00a0But I'm no longer interested because the servers lack initiative or interest in providing a consistent experience with each visit.In conclusion, if you want huge portions, for a low price, but are willing to deal with a laundry list of customer service faux pas; then this is your place. As for me, I'm going to stick to somewhere else that I have continued respect for and will instead return in a few months to see if things improve.Your individual experience may vary.","7\/15\/2019",545,2,"Open, matter time unlock doors, long posted hours - open means open.

It's a smaller restaurant that has a very intimate vibe with dim lighting and a partially open kitchen. To start we shared two tapas: the ravioli with hummus and truffle, and the calamari. Of the two, I preferred the calamari. The squid tasted fresh and it was saut\u00e9ed squid rather than breaded and deep fried squid, which was a pleasant change. In comparison the ravioli was a bit too rich and heavy. For my entree I opted for the paella and I was happy with my choice! The amount of seafood was abundant and the presentation was pretty.

Everybody's food looked so good too, it was freshly made as you can see the hot steam coming in the air while everybody is eating. Service was excellent considering we did came in a large group. They even came outside to take a group photo for us which you already know, it's time consuming when it's all girls xDThere's unlimited bread as appetizers, be careful or you might actually get too full before your entree comes out.

For those interested in making a large party reservation, they will typically require you to book a time earlier than their normal dinner hours and charge a late\/overtime fee if your group shows up late or stays beyond the allocated time. The service was very friendly throughout the evening and as they were prepared for our party, servers were very prompt as well. They quickly took everyone's individual pasta orders as they sat down and served the caesar salad shortly after. The dressing on the caesar was very flavorful and was not too salty or heavy. It did seem like the lettuce had been sitting in the dressing for a while though-- this might not be an issue with a regular dining experience.  I ordered the Penne alla Vodka, which I believe was the best dish out of the pre-selected options we were given. It was the perfect balance between creamy and tangy. There could've been a bit more sausage or veggies to mix up the texture though. I also had a bite of the Sun Dried Tomato Pesto con Linguine pasta, which was alright, but felt like it was missing a certain 'oomph'. Perhaps some extra spice or citrus (lemon squeeze?) would really brighten it up. The prawns served with the dish were very plump and fresh though! The tiramisu was average-- we did notice that each piece seemed to have a different flavor profile (more chocolatey, more alcoholic, more coffee) so there was a lack of consistency but the taste was fine.","5\/28\/2019",572,4,"My dining experience Pomodoro part large-party.

The food is just that good.My husband took me out to dinner at Pomodoro last night to celebrate my birthday. It is a lovely little restaurant, with creative lighting (red circle lights, tiny twinkling white lights, and warm yellowish-white lights), and crisp white tablecloths.I had the tomato cream soup, the paella, and I split the dungeness crab linguine with my husband. My husband also had the pork pancetta. My husband is characteristially very unenthusiastic, so when I asked him how his food was and he said \"good\" (he says \"okay\" 95%+ of the time that I ask him this question), I knew that the food was an unusually special experience for him, too! My food was absolutely outstanding, probably among the top ten meals I've ever eaten. The chef had a lovely long blurb included in the menu about his love for cooking, a few of his famous customers, and his experience as a chef. While I enjoyed reading this blurb, I definitely judged the food on my actual experience of eating it, which was heavenly.We also ordered a bottle of the Cava Mont Marcal wine. I enthusiastically recommend this wine. It was outstanding.Our waiter has a very genteel manner, but his memory and attentiveness are unfortunately severely lacking. We arrived fairly late, just after 9pm, and perhaps he'd had a long and busy night before we arrived. He also appeared to be pushing 90 years old.He smiled a lot and he seemed like he was trying his best, but he basically ignored us for the middle half of our meal. My husband had to literally get up out of his chair three times to go up to him when we needed something. He was just in his own world (also I think partially closing the restaurant, but we just couldn't get his attention for several minutes on end after several tries). He was respectful and sweet when he did get to us, however, he also brought up four very serious and upsetting topics (communism, genocide, global warming, and immigration), all of which I deeply care about, however, I would prefer very much to focus on lighter, more pleasant conversational topics while eating a celebratory birthday dinner. It was an odd experience - I must say I've actually never had a waiter bring up such topics when dining out.At the start of our meal, I informed the waiter that I am gluten-free due to a serious medical condition which gluten can aggravate terribly. I was happy to see that there are gluten-free options for many of the dishes, which I requested. He seemed to really listen to that, which is important to me, and I did not flare with my condition after eating my meal.However, at the end of the night, he brought me out a surprise piece of tiramisu with a flaming birthday candle on it. He had a huge smile on his face and he looked so excited, and I was delighted! However, when he put the piece of tiramisu in front of me I had a scared feeling for a second and asked him, \"Is this gluten-free?\" He said, \"No.\" I said, \"I can't eat it then, can you please take it away?\" He said, \"I'm sorry, I didn't know.\" I said, \"Yes, you did know, because I told you at the beginning of the meal that I am gluten-free due to a serious medical condition.\" He said again, \"I'm sorry, I didn't know.\" To be honest, the apology seemed genuine. He seems like a nice person. But it's a little scary that he completely forgot something that could have caused me serious pain.But then he said, \"well, your husband can eat it then.\" I said, \"My husband will not be eating birthday cake in front of me on my birthday that I am not able to eat.\" He offered me Spumoni or coffee on the house. I declined.I feel like he was really trying to make things right, I think he just wasn't getting it. I got upset and asked my husband to pay for our meals and asked my husband to leave a 20% tip to be polite (I usually tip between 23% - 27%).

I love this idea because there is no decision-making and no possibility of order regret (the worst). Each appetizer was tasty and was brought out at a nice pace. For the entree, I chose the steak which was cooked perfectly and the tempura-style fried mushrooms that came with were really yummy.

For SRW, we got to share 5 appetizers for the table and pick our individual entree + dessert. *BurrataIt had soft and creamy texture, love it! The sweet apple went really well with the cheese. The only downside was the grilled crostini. They were hard as rock and too dry. *Tomato SoupServed in a shot glass. Bold and refreshing flavor!*Baby LettucesServed with red wine vinaigrette but honestly tasted just like any regular salad.*Beef TartareSubtly seasoned and you can smell the aromatic bone marrow aioli permeated the beef tartare. Yum! Shame that the grilled crostini pieces were burnt, hard, and dry just like those served with the burrata.*Grilled Green BeansOur favorite appetizer! While they were only seasoned with salt and lemon, they were surprisingly addicting! Also love the sweet and smoky aftertaste! We were also told that they were meant to be \"finger food.\" Think of them as a healthier version of fries! *Grilled Coho SalmonThe salmon was mediocre and tasted like something you can whip up at home. The salsa verde was a good choice to enhance the flavor but I wasn't sure about the smoked turnip since it was quite bitter. *Pork Chuck LoinThe chuck loin was seasoned properly and that red wine sauce was good. The braised reddish vegetable (not sure what it was) added slight sweetness to the overall taste. Love it! *Pear ChiboustThe consistency resembles those of custards. The chiboust alone was remarkable but we both thought they put too much caramel sauce, making it a tad too sweet to enjoy. We could also taste cinnamon and ginger from the sauce which I wasn't a fan of. If you despise those two things, it might be something to watch for.Overall, some dishes were scrumptious and some were mediocre. The service was a bit spotty with one server was more attentive, friendlier, and less awkward than the other.

We ordered the burrata to start and shared the corn and ricotta ravioli, as well as the wagyu beef with fingerling potatoes. The burrata was delicious and very refreshing with the mint. I'm not super huge on a lot of mint on my food, but this was very tasty! The corn ricotta ravioli was also very good. It came with six ravioli and lobster mushrooms. It was light, flavorful, and definitely something I would order again. The wagyu beef was alright. For $35, I was hoping that the meat wasn't going to be as overdone as it was and not have gristle. Having to saw at the gristle and sift through parts of my meat isn't very enjoyable. But the fingerling potatoes were cooked very well.

Came here during restaurant week on a double date. Made a reservation - definitely necessary because it's packed and a smaller interior. We got seats by the chef so we had a glimpse into the kitchen - front row seats to some yummy cooking! During restaurant week, we could choose two items each from the appetizer and main course section and a dessert. You're encouraged to dine family style and share. My partner and I decided to share one appetizer and three pastas. All of the options looked so good so it took us a while to make this decision. We ordered the English Pea and Mint Burrata - if you've been to one of Ethan Stowells restaurants you'll know the burrata is AMAZING. This was a seasonal combo- and delicious. I've never known English peas and mint to taste so good together. We ate every last bit up and even got extra crostini to finish it up. I would go back for this burrata.The first pasta we got was the Rigatoni w\/ Pork Cheek and Snap Peas. Basically we saw pork cheek and knew we had to have it. This ended up being our favorite of the night. It's beautifully cooked, and snap peas are such a lovely addition. Per usual, the pork cheek was so soft and melts in your mouth. SO. GOOD. Would 100% come back for this, and I have a new found respect for snap peas in pasta.Next we got the Gnocchi with Pork Shoulder. I personally love all gnocchi's I've ever gotten at an Ethan Stowell so naturally I had to order this one. It didn't disappoint. Gnocchi were so light and pillowy. Our last pasta was the Paperdelle with Dungeness Crab. I didn't love this as much as I thought - maybe because it came out after the heavier dishes. It was a very light dish with a good serving of crab. I think next time I would definitely get the other pastas, and try something else instead of this (we were initially between this pasta and the truffle ravioli). We typically don't order dessert, but for restaurant week, it comes with your meal. We were pleasantly surprised and pleased with how thoughtful the desserts were here. We got the Seasonal Sorbet with Shortbread Cookie (Coconut and Lemon Sorbet) and the Chocolate Ganache Cake. The sorbet was delicious. Overall - awesome experience.

I was a bit worried because it seemed to have mixed reviews on yelp, but do not listen to them at all. This place is worth checking out. I had an incredible experience.

Hazelnut crumble and greens served with them.-Burrata - I had never tried burrata before so I was really excited for this and it definitely exceeded my expectations.

Because of my recent dental mishap, I broke off pieces of crostini eating it very carefully. Definitely, the bright flavors epitomized spring on a plate.

I probably would have given them a one star but the food overall wasn't terrible, just the service and everything else.We came here last night (Sunday night) for dinner around 6:30pm. Half the restaurant was empty including a fairly empty bar, yet there were at least a dozen people waiting to be seated. Our best assumption was that they were extremely low staffed, but how can you be so poorly staffed on a Sunday night?! They should have suggested to people that the bar was open seating at the very least. We had to check on our names multiple times to get any kind of update. When we finally got seated, no one came over to greet us or take drink orders or anything. We had to eventually flag down the host person to ask for our waiter so we can order. For food, we ordered the honey chicken wings and fresh spring rolls with shrimp and pork to share and we all got pho for entrees. I thought it was really weird that our waiter kept asking each person if they wanted tendon, and then I noticed that it's not included in any of the pho dishes and it's an add on for an additional $3.30! Which is INSANE. Who pays an extra $3.50 for tendon?! Luckily two of us said no but my friend didn't realize it was an add on and said yes cuz she thought it was already included so she felt tricked. So basically her oxtail pho was $19! The food overall was decent. The bowls of pho could have been bigger. The pho was extremely overpriced at $12.50-$15.50\/bowl depending on which one you ordered.

I don't frequent Vietnamese restaurants too often, but on this particular day, I was feeling a couple symptoms of a cold, so a hot bowl of noodle soup sounded quite comforting.The ambiance is rather trendy and modern with bright pops of color that liven up the dining area. I loved the look of the yellow posts that separate the bar from the rest of the room and the vibrant teal along the side windows. We were seated promptly and handed the menu which is essentially split into four main sections - small plates, vermicelli bowls, noodle soup and rotisserie items. There was also a menu of lunch specials with several options. The rotisserie duck sounded delicious, but I ultimately opted for the Pho Tai Nam.... a traditional bowl of pho with beef brisket and eye of round steak ($12). All four of us ordered a different type of pho. While my bowl came with a generous serving of noodles, and some bean sprouts, Thai basil leaves and jalapeno on the side, I was a little disappointed with the amount of beef included. \u00a0I found just a few paper thin slices of the steak and around 5-7 square pieces of brisket. The steak was delicious, cooked to a perfect medium and therefore didn't become overdone when dunked in the soup. I just wish there was more of it. The broth was soothing for my throat, being light with a full beefy flavor. Although all four of our bowls were served hot enough, we noticed they didn't come out with as much steam as those received by the table next to us. Usually with soup, I have to allow a few minutes for it to cool, but I was able to dig in right away. Most bowls of pho are between $12-15, which is on the steeper end. Overall, I enjoyed my lunch, but it wasn't memorable enough to differentiate Ba Bar's version from a beef pho at any other typical Vietnamese restaurant.Service was friendly and we were checked on at least a couple times during our meal, which was considerate as the lunch rush began picking up around noon.

It adds a refreshing kick. Smoked Salmon - Another yummy dish that we got that didn't disappoint. I've never had a slab of smoked salmon before (usually would get them in slices for a bagel or crack) so this was delightful since I love smoked salmon. The cream was a nice compliment to the salmon. Spring Greens - The buttermilk sauce for this was surprising refreshing, probably due to the mint. Not a fan of radishes but overall, it was a good vegetable side to have!Black Rice - Really liked this dish a lot! It's unique and was our heavy dish for the meal.

The oyster happy hour deals are 1\/2 off (4-5PM) and 1\/4 off (5-6PM).

We really liked the Rockfish Ceviche and the Mussels - the ceviche is really refreshing, but the mussels are so meaty and come in this rich yellow sauce on sourdough bread.. it's a nice contrast between the two. The Albacore was good and unique with its coconut & mango additions, but was not up to par with the other two. We also had a \"treat yourself\" moment and also decided to pick something off the grill portion of the menu too, in which we decided on the Spanish Octopus. To be honest, we thought this dish was okay. The octopus comes out fried like tempura and it's crunchy and not bad, but it just tasted like any other tempura to me, compared to the other unique dishes full of flavor. Probably wouldn't order this one again.Overall though, we really enjoyed this restaurant. It was cute, cozy, and the food was of high quality.

We didn't have reservations, but I was able to call ahead to check out the wait time. There was none, so we parked and hopped right in for fancy southern comfort food.LOCATIONIt's a modern restaurant with some rustic charm - there are 2 dining areas. One has booths and tables to sit in, while the other side is more like a parlor with lounge chairs and bistro tables. It might be a little difficult to come here with large groups if you don't have a reservation handy.Street parking only, which is a pain in this area. We were able to find some parking a few blocks up, but plan ahead as street parking is a little sparse during the day.FOODOyster Po Boy: I was already familiar with their fried oysters from happy hour, so I knew this would be good. They have REALLY good fried oysters, and that was reflected in this po boy. The roasted tomatoes gave it a nice sweetness that went with the remoulade. I wish the bread was a little softer on the inside as it did make it difficult to bite into. Salad was a nice break, better than french fries IMO.Chicken and Waffles: This dish is hit or miss, but this was definitely a hit. One of the better chicken and waffles in the area, it's simple comfort food. The waffles are crisp and sweet - they don't get super soggy under the maple syrup. The fried chicken was also good, crispy and moist but flavorful enough to compliment the waffles.Brisket Hash: This is comparable to a fancy steak and eggs with a side of potatoes. The brisket was very tender and flavorful, it really carried the dish with the poached eggs. Served with a side of wheat toast (you get to pick), I think this was a pretty balanced dish. I wish there was a little more brisket though...VALUEComing from the Bay Area, I'm used to paying $15+ for an entree... especially for brunch. I think for the quality it was worth. Portions might be a little smaller, but we were satisfied with our meal.OVERALLFrank's Oyster House is a fantastic brunch option if you're in the area. It's close the University of Washington, so if you're visiting I'd recommend checking this place out for brunch or even happy hour.I've been a fan of Frank's since college, and I'm glad they're still around. I used to come here as a college student for late night happy hour in the parlor - when you're a broke engineering student spending late hours in lab, sometimes your only options for dinner is late night happy hour.

You choose from three sizes (small, medium or large). It's cafeteria style where you grab a tray, tell them your order, pick any tempura\/extras you want and then pay. There's water and hot water at the drink station. Busk your own tables when you're done eating.Awesome that you can see the udon noodles being made fresh while you wait in line. Green onions, grated fresh ginger and tempura flakes are free to add into your bowl.- 2x Onion ring tempura ($0.33 US each) - these were sitting out for awhile so they weren't fresh but still tasty. It tastes better dipped in their tempura sauce.- Curry udon ($10.50 US large) - spicy Japanese curry dashi soup with beef, onions and green onions. They give you a massive amount of noodles which had a springy bite and retained a good texture the whole time. Broth is flavourful. Solid.- Tan tan udon ($10.00 US large) - topped with spicy pork, wakame and house made chili oil. I was surprised that the broth was actually spicy. Good kick to both the broth and meat.

I was a little disappointed about this because one of the most exciting things about korean restaurants for me is the banchan. Ended up paying 5$ for a kimchi trio which honestly was just.. generic.

But, I came for the bbq, so I had to get it. Their other dishes also looked good so we ordered a few other options as well. Brisket is the staple kbbq cut. SoB's brisket is honestly great. High fat content for the perfect juicy bite. Their Pork Belly is also pretty good. Again, high fat content which makes for a great blend of crispy and fatty when you grill the pork. Their Soonduboo (tofu soup) is really high quality, as you should expect at $12. Their tofu is silky smooth, my only gripe with this dish was that they skimp a little on the meat. Great taste, I would have liked it to be a tad spicier. The game changer for me was their cheese corn. Honestly the best cheese corn I've ever had. At $8, it's a little pricy, but just get it.

We come for the chili, chicken sliders, and the yam fries. The weather was windy and raining and my husband and I were cold and tired after a long week at work. So we decided to come here for our comfort food. I was glad that they could seat us right away. We ordered the usual. When the chili arrived I was so excited and after the first bite, I was so disappointed since the Chili was cold. Yike. When you are cold and come for chili, the worst thing is cold chili. The manager took my chili to warm it up. By the time the chili came back, i had finished eaten the sweet potato fries (very few of them) without the chili since I was hungry. The chili arrived almost when my husband has finished his meal and to begin with, this delay was a disappointment to start with since it took away from the experience of our date night. The chili came back very dry and the color had changed as though they had fried the chili. I took a bite and it burnt the heck out of my mouth. My tongue was burnt and the skin from the roof of my mouth came off. So painful. So not only the chili was not good, but it was DANGEROUSLY hot. The waitress took the chili away and said we will not charge you. That is not a great customer service since I didn't eat anything so, for sure they had to take this off of our bill. But no apologies or anything. I was dumbfounded of how poor the service is and how they didn't care that their food caused pain. I asked to speak with the manager, Amanda. She was not better. When I told her the my mouth is so burnt and is painful, she said \"we tried to bring the chili back to the right temp.\" Well, the right temp is not so dang hot that causes burn. She said, \"we took it off your bill.\" Yes you did, because it was not edible. When I told her how disappointing it is to come in for a date night after a long week working for your comfort food and have an experience like this, she said, \"sorry\". That is it. When I told her that I am going to write a review on Yelp and Google on this experience, she said, \"wait, I can give you a couple of comp coupons for a free meal.\" Amanda, I can pay for my own meals, but you should have offered that when our food was wrong and when I burnt my tongue. For me, this shows how poorly managed is this restaurant. 1. the cook\/chef doesn't know the right temp for food2. the waitress didn't understand a thing about customer service and treated us like a cattle that we need to get out and not charging us for a food item that we could not eat was a great customer service.3. The shift manger, Amanda, had no clue the seriousness of this issue of food safety and she had no idea of how to handle this. She just tried to do something after i said I am going to write a review.

The Brussels sprouts were a tad on a sweet side but charred well so it was balanced. The falafel while tasty was a bit oily. As for the main course, here was where I was more disappointed. The shrimp salad had some rice noodles in there and were al dente, well more like under cooked. As for the short rib burger, I probably shouldn't have ordered it naked, since it came with a arugula salad underneath the burger with lemon vinaigrette.

To see a restaurant open nearby that specializes in suancai yu, the restaurant's namesake, really intrigued me!Immediately when you walk in, you notice that this place has a really nicely themed decor. The wallpapers are all well-designed around the idea of their fish. One wall has a giant 9-panel TV that is playing a documentary about where they source their fish. While it may feel a bit out of place, I can't deny it was kinda cute. The way this restaurant is designed definitely reminds me of a newer restaurant that might open up in China, which I really appreciated.Upon being seated, all of the staff there yells \"????\", or \"Welcome\". This may be a bit off-putting at first, and some people might find it uncomfortable, but I honestly found it incredibly endearing! When they bring the food out, the staff also yells \"??\", or \"Food has arrived\", which was just another one of those cute and endearing things.Moving onto the food, we ordered their specialty suancai yu in the small size, and two orders of hongtang ciba, deep-fried rice cake with red sugar syrup. The food came out pretty quickly, and the first thing I want to say about the fish is that despite the small size being recommended for 1-2 people, I felt like it was plenty for the party of three that I came with. The fish is undeniably fresh. The flavor is definitely there; the broth and pickled vegetables definitely do not overpower the fishiness. That being said, there was no real funk to the fish, which made it all the more enjoyable. The fish was sliced into small pieces, and it was thoroughly deboned, meaning that it was very easy to eat the fish, and there wasn't much of a hassle. What I really appreciated, however, was the fact that the broth was just the right strength of flavor. This kind of dish can definitely lean towards the saltier side at many other places, but I think that their aware that the fish and pickled vegetables already give the broth enough of that salty flavor, and so there wasn't much of a need to make it anymore salty. The fish also had a good amount of spice, but nothing that was too much to handle. But with that being said, I can handle spice pretty well, so I may not be very qualified to speak on that aspect.I don't have much to say about the deep-fried rice cake. It was very crispy and crunchy on the outside, the fry was really nice, and the inside was chewy and very mochi-esque. The flavor of the syrup takes a bit of time to really hit. At first, it might just taste like breakfast syrup, but the flavor of the red sugar comes through after a few seconds. Overall, it's a really good way to balance out the sourness and saltiness of the fish!Overall, this place is quite an enjoyable experience. The service here was really nice and attentive, though it definitely helps if you speak Chinese here. Do I think it's a bit overpriced? Yeah, maybe a bit, but I think that the flavor helps me to look past it. I'm super happy to see that there are new, fresh Chinese restaurants opening up in University District, and will definitely come back here to try new things out!","9\/2\/2019",905,4,"Came couple friends newly opened I'm always excited curious try new Chinese restaurants, they're starting diversify serve.

It's unlike anything I've ever tasted (in a good way). The numbing spicy flavor infused with the sourness of the pickled vegetables creates a complex flavor that complements the fish very well. However, its level of spiciness is not for the faint of heart - and there's unfortunately no way to adjust the spiciness. If you have seafood allergies, this is not the place for you, as this fish is the only main entree they serve. We added enoki mushrooms and clear noodles to the fish, which were a nice addition. We also ordered their chicken wings (probably the best of these three), pickled cucumber, and sticky rice cakes as appetizers, none of which were too standout.

I've been communicating with Weichy, Salare's Service Director, for a month in preparation for a friend's birthday dinner. She was extremely accommodating, friendly, professional, and inviting. She was open to any and all requests and suggestions I made. Granted, a lot of it would have to come out of my own preparation and effort, but they were open to allowing all of it, but she helped me execute half of it, which made the evening that much more special for our friend. She even called me the day before to give me (my table) the first chance at ordering their seasonal pork shank (butchered freshly in-house) that wasn't even on the menu. We took her up on that offer and I am so glad we did. It was incredible. The braised pork was literally fall-off-the-bone tender.For appetizers, we had the Cougar Gold Cheddar & Chive Biscuit and Salumi & Charcuterie. Both fantastic choices as you'll see by the photo.For dinner, we shared family style with the 1) pork shank (which, again, wasn't on the menu).

Wonderful, classic style pasta. 4) Monkfish with purple savory clams, honey mussels, fennel & bouillabaisse broth. I could probably do without the monk fish ONLY because I'm generally not a fan of fish (let alone monk fish), but I'm all about new experiences, and I can appreciate a good sauce, which this dish had.

We'll coming back lot frequently",1.0],[48,"I vacillated between four and five stars. What pushed me to five stars was the realization of what chef Edouardo Jordan was trying to accomplish here.Salare is a fusion of his southern (Florida) roots, his African heritage, and his training and accomplishments at such diverse places as Italy (learning charcuterie), The French Laundry, Per Se, The Herbfarm, Sitka & Spruce, and Bar Sajor. What a fusion!The food here is incredible and creative. This place will challenge your palate--even for what you thought was going to be a typical preparation of some main ingredient you were familiar with. The other ingredients and the spicing in the dish (not to mention the preparation techniques) are likely to bring flavor combinations you've never experienced before to your palate. That's a good thing. Different can be good. Relax and enjoy.Always up for a challenge to my palate, I tried the tripe with porcini mushrooms, nantes carrots, chickpeas, and hen egg. The spicing whispered of influences from both Africa and The French Laundry. It was piquant and mildly peppery, creamy and varied in texture at the same time, and completely delightful. I've had many preparations of tripe around the world, and this was the best I have tasted. It was also very filling.My dining companions both had the sliced ribeye, with baby potatoes, padr\u00f3n peppers, beets, and horseradish ricotta. That was also a tasty dish, with an exotic mix of spices on the meat.We passed on appetizers this trip to try the desserts. The spiced squash sorbet was good, with both some familiar and some inventive spicing. The roasted pumpkin cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9e (with cinnamon madrona cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche, pepita bark, candied squash, and maple bacon macaron) was among the best cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9es I've had, and the various flavors all blended well. The pavlova (with spiced pears, buttermilk granita, lemon thyme curd, fromage blanc mousse, and fig sherbet) was a smorgasbord of pleasing desserts one one plate. And the plum upside-down cake (with plum wine grenade, peach caramel, brown butter streusel, and lemon verbena ice cream) was the star of the desserts, and one of the most amazing tasting and palate pleasing desserts I've ever had.Portion sizes are reasonable, neither huge nor tiny. Just right really, given the unique taste combinations you will experience.It's easy to see why Edouardo Jordan won the 2018 James Beard award in May as Best Chef: Northwest for his work here. (His newer restaurant, JuneBaby, is just down the street. It won the 2018 James Beard award for the Best New Restaurant in the USA.)We will definitely be returning to try more of this food. And you should too. Especially if you can't get in to JuneBaby. The difference is Salare is African-influenced fusion. JuneBaby is pure, straight-on African-influenced Southern USA food.

So glad I did.Arriba is taking Mexican cooking arriba, arriba, arriba--elevating the food is subtle but important ways. Don't expect the gloopy cheddar cheese nonsense of Americanized Mexican restaurants. This is much more like a sophisticated restaurant I would expect to see in Mexico City. The flavors are still decidedly Mexican, but the quality of the ingredients, the creativity in the preparations, and the execution all elevate the cuisine.Many of the ingredients are made in house, and that includes the unique salsas and the queso fresco. Other ingredients are locally sourced and high quality, giving Arriba a farm to table flair. These are all good things.The salsas are all worth trying. They are unique, appealing, and delicious--either by themselves with just chips or as an accompaniment to various dishes. I just wish there wasn't avocado in any of the sauces (I am allergic, so it keeps me from trying a couple of the salsas).The black beans that accompanied my carne asada were excellent. The spicing is unique--unless you've been to Mexico. The spices here (not going to give away the secret ingredient--just expect a mild licorice taste) are sophisticated and well suited to these beans. Excellent. Yeah, it's different. It's also excellent. Again, reminds me of something I would expect to be served at a good restaurant in Mexico City.The asada was perfectly cooked, juicy, and very tasty. I would order it again in a heartbeat. It was a bit odd at first to find my asada already cut up for me and to see it served on a bed of pea greens--but both things worked to elevate the dish a bit in the end.I tried the flan for dessert. It's different and a bit more like a panna cotta or creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e type custard. Very creamy and rich. But it's not the normal texture you associate with flan. Give in. Your taste buds will thank you.The restaurant is relatively new. The menu changes with the harvest seasons, and I am sure it is changing as the restaurant gets its legs. (This is why I gave four stars for now--though I suspect five stars is coming soon. Just need to work out some tiny hiccups in execution.) You can either go along for a culinary journey that may challenge some of your preconceived (yellow gooey cheese) notions and deliver great food experiences, or you can complain.If you want to complain, then please go find some run of the mill Americanized Mexican place to frequent. If you want to see what elevated Mexican cuisine can be like without having to travel to Mexico City (or to some Rick Bayless restaurant in Chicago), then eat here.I suspect we'll see this place on a few \"best\" lists in the coming years.

Arriba Cantina also has all-day happy hour on Sunday with $6 margaritas (more on this below). Add all of these factors together, and you get a recipe for a very happy woman living her best tequi-life. Let's start with the drinks!Slushy margaritas are my favorite. And these do not disappoint. You can add a little syrup to it if you want some flavor: raspberry, strawberry, there may be a seasonal rhubarb coming up?, and, my favorite, hibiscus! Normally $9, these alone were reason enough to come to Arriba Cantina for Happy Hour where they are only $6. They go down very quickly. I wasn't as big of a fan of the house margarita. It wasn't bad, per say, but I tasted a lot of straight tequila. Pro: strong, con: I'm not sure if there was much else in there...Si to the spicy! Spicy margarita was on the rocks (still muddled like any good marg is) and had some jalapenos in there. The rim salt had a little kick too. All in all, a solid margarita with just a hint of some heat. Apparently, if I truly want to add some spice, I need to order the Diablo. I will report back when this has been ordered. Gee, those drinks made me very hungry. Which brings us to food!First off, the chips are delish. They are thicker and crunchy and very fresh. Chips and salsa come with an assortment. I'm a fan of the super spicy tamarind habanero (I believe), corn salsa, and red standard pureed salsa. The pineapple and verde are good and more on the mild side for those with a more delicate palate. Second, I have only had a small sampling. Overall, I can say I wish the food had more heat, but again, I like a spice level that clears the sinuses. The flautas were yummy with cheese and chicken and baked goodness. The carnitas tacos were very soft. It's a great start. I've heard great things about their brunch scramble and dessert flautas. Sadly, they ran out of the dessert flautas when I was there last (a good sign, IMO). And finally, what's the place like? For Happy Hour, loved the bar area. Loved the strings of lights and the burnt wood work. For dining and families, the dining area has lots of space, natural light, and a huge custom mural that shows the beaches of Puerto Vallarta turning into the beaches of Seattle. Super cool! While I am more of a bar person myself, I will recommend this place the next time my family is in town as there are three little ones who would love a good quesadilla while the rest of us enjoy a marg.

Our area by the windows was peaceful and sparsely populated, making it the perfect location for a nice, pleasant dinner.Food: I ordered the gnocchi while my boyfriend ordered (you guessed it) the squid ink fettuccine.

I decided to make the trek to the Village over the three day weekend, and had my eye on Piatti for happy hour and to grab dinner to go. Boy, it did NOT disappoint.I am a sucker for good octopus, which isn't an item you see on a ton of menus around the Pacific Northwest. I was thrilled to see it on their happy hour menu, which is what initially drew me here. It seems they have a rotating preparation of the octopus. When I stopped in, it was wood-fired octopus with chorizo braised white beans, tomato confit, and arugula. At $10 on happy hour, it's a steal. This dish was simply to die for. The octopus was unbelievably tender and paired so well with the smokey chorizo and creamy white beans. It was a struggle to finish it all and could truly serve as a meal in and of itself. However, we did also order one order of their ciabatta bread. The bread was excellent as well: so soft and fluffy seasoned perfectly with salt, garlic, and some other herbs. It was served with olive oil and a nice herbed balsamic vinegar. I'd definitely recommend it to accompany your meal, especially at a mere $3 on happy hour.To go, I ordered their house made pappardelle and duck bolognese. This, too, was heavenly. I've had other house made pasta that was too thin and mushy. I appreciated this fresh pasta really maintained its integrity. It was still nice and elastic even after reheating at home. And the bolognese itself was perfection. Though prepared classically with carrot, celery, and Italian spices, it was really a memorable dish. The duck was a refreshing change from the typically heavy and often flavorless beef you get in so many bolognese dishes. The restaurant itself is massive. We were promptly seated and the service was friendly. The drinks are a bit on the high side, even on happy hour, but the phenomenal happy hour and killer dinners more than made up for it.Overall, I think Piatti is a must-stop when you're in the U-Village area.","1\/21\/2019",1048,5,"Living West Seattle, I rarely make University Village.

Decent place to linger, so I'm posting my thoughts while onsite.It's new, been open for business maybe two or three weeks tops. Hours are decent, open daily 10am to 10pm. Bright with the large expanse of windows along the sidewalk and decent overhead lighting for you readers, writers, and artists. And yes, WiFi and lots of plugs for the laptop and smart phone crowd.Wide variety of seating, including a faux fireplace, large flat screen, and decent cafe music playlist during this initial visit.Unlike most cafes with just baked goods, Urban Luxe Cafe has really delicious savory offerings too. I tried the sandwich plate with tender kebab meat on toasted bread. The final product is warm, cheesy, and melds well with the other ingredients provided. Very generous and eye pleasing for a solo dinner. Accompanying items included grape tomatoes, pickled asparagus spears, pitted kalamata olives, dolmathes, and feta. (Postscript, noticed later that my plate didn't include some baklava per the menu. Bummer.)The larger platter would be great to share (or not!) with the warm pita, assorted dips like hummus, and pickled stuff and things.My mocha is spot on for balanced flavor, temperature, and the latte art. The barista\/counterperson is very personable. Knowlegeable about the menu items and gladly will answer your questions or make recommendations. Fellow Shoreliner too.

I've had most of the cuts and enjoyed them all. If you are looking for something different than just a steakhouse chop, I recommend trying the steak skewers. Each steak comes with a salad, steamed vegetables and a potato option - if you can't decide between potato pancakes and mashed potatoes then order a UFO which gives you both.Brunch:We are frequent \"brunchers\" here. All of the portions are really large and reasonably priced. So if you want to try Jak's on a budget this is a great option.

Each time we've been, it has just been missing the mark and was never as good as we remembered.I must start off by saying the service is great, I love that it's a casual steak restaurant, the food is a good value, and there's a convenient parking lot in the back. I had debated between going to Jak's or Capital Grille, but wanted to support a local restaurant rather than a chain.Food wise, it was OK. When ordering a steak, it also comes with sourdough bread, salad, potatoes (of your choice) and veggies. I ordered the Seattle Ribeye which was a special of theirs at the moment (bone-in ribeye with caramelized onions and mushrooms on top) and my bf got the Jak's size filet mignon. I am no steak expert, I'm just sharing my humble opinion, but I think getting the larger filet mignon was a mistake. I think because the filet was such a thick cut of meat, getting it perfectly cooked in the middle without doing some damage to the outer layers was difficult. The filet was quite dry on the outter layers of the steak, even burnt at some parts. My ribeye was definitely the better of the two picks since it did not have that problem - the meat itself was thinner and had more fat and marbling to retain juices. The flavor of both steaks was just lacking something however. Both dishes also literally had half a head of cooked broccoli on the top which was a not worth the effort to cut down and eat. I had mashed potatoes which were fine (I wish there was gravy for it) and my bf had fries which were really good.We don't get steaks too often, usually when there is a special occasion, so it was a bummer that we both left feeling disappointed by Jak's.","7\/1\/2018",1118,3,"This third time Jak's years I'm sad say likely last.

Why is 3.5 the golden rating for great Asian restaurants?

But multiple people had strongly recommended us to try them out, plus our friend who was researching Thai food in Seattle was also being pushed by his friends and family to check out Thai Tom. The strong recommendation piqued our curiosity.All of us are from Asia country and we are well familiar and have had experiences with some of the best \"street food\" that only cost like pennies. In our mind, that was what Thai Tom probably is. We got here on a Wednesday at around 6:30pm and there were several couples sitting at the tables already but the bar was still empty. The lady greeted us and seated us at a prime spot at the bar, right by where the cooking show took place so we were ecstatic. We got to feel the heat from the flaming woks, right where the spices and the chili assortment too, being able to watch the cooks cooking in all 6-8 woks all at once, throwing spices into the woks, throwing eggshells into the bins next to the stoves, fast motions and cooking endlessly and tirelessly. People kept coming in, and within 3 minutes of us sitting down, the place was completely packed, phone never stopped ringing for takeout orders either while the line was forming outside. All these built up an even higher expectation of what's about to go down lol. Our friend asked the lady for recommendation and we ordered their Shrimp Tom Yum, Thai Fried Rice with Chicken, Shrimp Pad Thai, Chicken Panang Curry, plus three Thai iced tea. She told us that they don't serve anything with pineapple and they only have shrimps from the seafood side, so there's no calamari, no mussels, etc. And yes they use MSG in their food, quite a lot of it actually.. we watched with our own eyes. Maybe we had built up certain expectation and excitement but we felt really underwhelmed with our food. The highlight of our meal was their Tom Yum soup which was very tangy and enjoyable, whilst our other dishes were very underwhelming. Although they had that charred taste, but they were overall lacking flavors and a little mushy. Our friend thought the fried rice was quite good as well but nothing to write home about.With the queue waiting outside, do expect to be rushed out of the place to accommodate the line even when you're still working on your food. Our bill came about $53 so I wouldn't say that it's super cheap per se, and the portion here is just about right but not abundant by any means. But one thing that I must admit. I kind of enjoy the vibe, reminds me a lot of Asia... how hectic it was with the staff preparing the foods, the noises, and the customers waiting patiently for their food while enjoying their drink. However, if you think this place offers great Thai food, then you kind of have missed out.

I spent around $17 dollars for my order but the amount of fullness I get was unparalleled. Food wise, their fried chicken was american and asian inspired since the breading was different and I would describe to have a texture of chicken karage.

The tortillas were a bit too thick for my liking and the sauce was a bit salty. The other filling was really good! The lettuce was fresh and had a nice crunch to balance the soft tortilla and tender chicken. It's really just the flavor of the sauce and the tortilla that didn't make this taco so good.Right now the rating is how it is when it first opened, but I'm sure it'll get better as they learn with this opening period.
