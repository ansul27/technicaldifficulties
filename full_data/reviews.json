    "review": "Small Szechuan restaurant in the U District. Interior is simple, but clean. Went there on a Sunday. Not super busy when we went in, but the place started filling up later into lunch hour. Pretty standard Szechuan fare. Got a dry pot with a bunch of ingredients, the spicy sour fish, a tofu dish and some stir-fried mustard greens. They all tasted pretty decent with authentic flavors. Nothing we ordered was super spicy. I actually the thought the mustard greens were the tastiest, but the other stuff was alright. Portions are okay; not the biggest but not tiny either. The four of us paid about $25 each for the meal.",

    "review": "Yummy is all I can say. Went here for Sunday lunch and was not disappointed. My favorite Chinese restaurant in Bellevue is closing so glad I found this place. They don't have parking so you have to drive around to find street parking. It's a decent size restaurant with open seating. Walked in and was seated immediately. They did have super loud music playing and it was hard to have a conversation with our server when ordering food.I went there hungry so ordered few dishes-Fried rice- ordered the veggie option which was delish. Unlike other fried rides this didn't have the oily/greasy feeling to it.Chicken wings-we opted for the garlic version which was on the dry side and yet tasty. Garlic bok choy- right amount of garlic and it wasn't overpowering.Deep fried pepper fish- you think fried fish it would be drenched in oil, right? Nope not this one. I was impressed with how flavorful this fish was with just peppers. Overall good food quality and tasty. Price is very reasonable as well. Good atmosphere and service. Our server Rae(Ray) was very friendly and checked up on us during our dining. I will definitely be coming back to try other menu items.",

    "review": "I went here on Sunday afternoon, after lunch rush hour. It was little hard to find a place for parking around but I found one eventually. Inside of the restaurant is clean and well organized. What I liked about their menu having all the ingredient information, spicy level, and numbness level. I ordered four dishes:-Tomato with egg was really good that the acidity of tomato and mildness of egg go really well. -Tofu with special yolk sauce was something new that I tried first time ever. It seems like they used the salted yolk in the sauce which make the food taste very eggy. I loved it! This one was very soft and hearty! Â -Deep fried intestine with pepper is not that spicy even with a lot of peppers, so don't be afraid to order this. If you under-cook instestine it could have very bad smell, but this one was well prepped and cooked properly so it was delicious. Very crunchy and you can taste the good pork fat. Yummm!!-I was surprised of the texture of the shredded pork dish. It wasn't spicy but little tangy, and it also has bunch of crunchy textures including the black ear mushroom, carrot, and bamboo shoot. I couldn't stop eating this because of the crunchiness. Overall foods were a bit salty for me but if you considering these are supposed to be eaten with rice, it is not that bad. Don't forget to order rice with your order unless it is noodle. All menus that I ordered was flavorful and I enjoyed the numbness of intestine dish. I think this place is where you can take to szechuan begginers because it is not too overwhelmed with numbness/spiciness but it is pretty good and close to home-cooking food. There are more dishes that I want to try out so I will come back.",

I will definitely order it again. Our waitress told us that this dish was voted Top 10 on the menu by customers. No wonder! I also saw it on the lunch special menu -- very affordable and delicious option for lunch.Boiled fish with sour pickled cabbage. I loved the soup, the sour pickled cabbage, and the clear noodle inside. If you like boiling fish in general and would like to try a sour and spicy soup, this IS the dish to order! You can customize the spice level from non spicy to super spicy (yea, Red Pepper has red peppers).My girl friend and I shared the rice noodle in red soup. The portion was HUGE. The bowl was as big as a person's face. We also ordered a pure green dish to balance out (hehe).I had a great time with my girl friend here last night (Tuesday). We went around 5pm, and got a booth seat close to the TV. We ordered a lot (4 dishes for 2 girls) and took our time to eat, chat, and enjoy. By the time we left around 7pm, there was already a line at the front door.",

I always walk through this place when I'm looking for places to eat around U-district. Me and my friend finally decide to give them a try. The food on their menu looks pretty good, we ordered couple of entree and etc to share with. My favorite out of the 5 entrees was the \"Dry pot with chicken.\" All the entree we got tasted pretty decent and decent portion as well. The service there is alright, pretty attentive when you needed them.Overall, I will come back once a while when I visit my friend around UW area for Spicy food. I feel like this could be one of the top choices for Sichuan cuisine in the U-district area but not for sure yet. Still have plenty of other places to try out.",

    "review": "Decent Chinese food in the heart of U District - nothing amazing, but it'll get the job done.I came here on a Saturday night, and what a mistake that was - driving around to look for street parking was extremely difficult, especially since this was right on the Ave. I found free street parking on the other side of the block from this restaurant, and just had to walk 3 mins to get here.The spot was pretty dead in terms of customers - there were maybe 3 or 4 parties there at the time. I was seated immediately, and I quickly ordered the double cooked pork belly. Within 5 minutes, the dish came out, piping hot. The dish was okay, they did give a lot of pork belly slices, but the slices were super thin. The sauce had a good amount of heat though, and it wasn't like the pork was just drenched in the sauce. What surprised me was the overall cost. The pork belly itself was $16, then my order of white rice cost an extra $2. The total with tip ended up being around $20, which I think is a lot for just one person. Luckily, Groupon has a 20% cash back deal with Red Pepper, which is the only reason I came. I don't think Red Pepper would ever be worth the full price you're asked to pay.There's better Chinese food out there, but if you're nearby and just want something to fill your stomach, this place won't hurt.",

We shared photos of ourselves eating here on social media, and had multiple friends who had moved out of the area say it is the one place they always eat at when they come back to Seattle. It's that good!!We were in the area and craving teriyaki and Yelp lead us right to this place. We walked in to find seating for only 10 people max, so each table feels like a chef table. The menu was huge and fairly priced and they have even expanded it to include Korean favorites like kimchi fried rice. As we were waiting for our food, the woman at the register told us they don't use a rice cooker because they want each customer to have fresh rice. They only do small batches on the stove to maintain a high quality. Impressive! Even more impressive was the teriyaki!! The chicken was lean and portions were huge. The pork was so good my wife (who ordered chicken) kept stealing pieces off my plate. On our second visit, we tried the beef teriyaki in addition to the chicken and pork. Each meat we tried was more tender than the last. Truly incredible teriyaki. The kimchi fried rice was incredible too! It was full of that refreshing flavor from kimchi with a perfect level of spice, almost enough to make you sweat. On our way out after our first visit, the woman at the register noticed my wife was far along in her pregnancy and said she would pray for a safe delivery. It worked! A few days later my wife delivered a healthy baby. I went it and showed her pictures and she couldn't get enough of them. Incredible service, incredible food, huge portions, and fair prices. Just go here already!!",

For our family vacation, I've looked into multiple Teriyaki shops with positive reviews PLUS potential spots that we could visit/see around the area. Teriyaki 1st has become one for a perfect spot with Gas Works Park and UW. I like to get the negativity away first; so, it is the ambiance. If I am harsh, it's disgusting. However, it has been open for many years in such a unique spot that they are doing best to keep the restaurant clean as possible. Only 3 tables for 2 people sit on each table and limited chairs on the bar-like area. So, totally not the best spot to eat in-store. However, my family did, lol. Honestly, it was not too bad. There is a thing in my personal logic where older the restaurant looks, better the food tastes. Old is different from dirty, it's more like ancient, lol. Anyways, we ordered 2 chicken teriyaki and 1 spicy chicken teriyaki. Portion is A LOT for its price; so, I would totally recommend to UW students. I love places that gives large portion for appropriate price since I was an Undergrad, which is not too long ago. So, I'm still like that, lol. #CollegeLoanProbs. Anyways, the rice was definitely good as it is possibly steam cooked from a pot unlike the one from rice cooker. The chicken was super tender. No toughness at all. The sauce was really good and loved how the meal was served without the sauce. The \"salad\" was great to counteract as cleansing method for the body, lmao. The salad dressing was super good. I would love to have this level of quality of Teriyaki near my home. Meanwhile, I have pictures that I can look to remember how good it was.Check out my foodie IG @eumsiktography",

Teriyaki 1st was at the top of bucket list and it did not disappoint again. Some of my friends doubted me because they didn't believe such a humble-sounding and humble-looking restaurant could serve such amazingly simple and simply amazing food.But when we stopped by, grabbed the still $9 Chicken Teriyaki to go, drove to Gas Works Park, and shared the meal while watching the night fall over the city in slightly breezy, 70 degree weather, their eyes lit up brighter than the lights from the city skyline because of how good the food was. In fact, by the time we were leaving the park, they were heavily considering going back to get more of that delectable chicken teriyaki over rice.Seattle in the summer + Teriyaki 1st + Gas Works Park. Life doesn't get much better than that.Note:During my second visit last summer to Teriyaki 1st, I asked the man at the front how they made their chicken teriyaki dish so good. He said it's all about having a lot of perfectly steamed white rice to complement the chicken.This time during my third visit, I asked the lady at the front how they made their chicken teriyaki dish so good. She said it's all in the sauce. I asked her multiple times to share a part of her secret recipe, but she politely declined.Next summer, during my fourth visit, I'll be sure to figure out at least a part of the secret to the magic of Teriyaki 1st.",

It's true, there used to be many more teriyaki places that are now being replaced with fancy restaurants, leaving fewer places to find that cheap, sweet Japanese comfort food that seems to be much more popular here than other cities.Teriyaki 1st is located on the northern part of the Ave in UDistrict -- the perfect location for college kids looking for filling meals at low prices. The restaurant itself is small, and can probably only seat about 10 people, but takeout is really the way to go. The menu looked pretty big, but I didn't really peruse it since I came for one thing and one thing only. Chicken teriyaki.The food was done before I was done using the restroom. The weight of the to-go container in the plastic bag let me know that I was going to be very full. We walked to a nearby park to enjoy our meal. The teriyaki comes with a small side salad that is nothing special, but it's nice to start (or finish) your meal with some fresh veggies. The main dish was simple, yet beautiful. A large portion of grilled chicken on top of an enormous bed of rice. It comes with a small container of sweet teriyaki sauce -- I would probably ask for another small container next time. The sauce is pretty sweet, but it's just so good, especially when it soaks into the rice. YUM.I barely finished, and I only pushed myself because I didn't want to carry the leftovers around the rest of the day. I could have easily stretched this $10 meal into two; I was pretty hungry, but didn't even eat dinner! It's a shame that this place is so far away, and I'm sure there are plenty of great teriyaki places around, but after coming here and seeing the bang for your buck, I'd be hard pressed to go somewhere else.",

I've been coming to Teriyaki 1st over almost four years now. Would recommend Teriyaki 1st 100% to anyone. My favorite order would be the spicy chicken. Man, just so good. My second favorite would be the chicken yakisoba, mind blowing good.

I'm new to Seattle and have heard all about the Teriyaki rave that everyone seems to be obsessed with.Well, this place is near my apartment and seemed like a good quick dinner. As the reviews say, this is located in a sketchy strip mall, a bit grimy if you will. There aren't many seats inside, and no atmosphere to speak of so I recommend that if you go, take it to go! A friend and I ordered the chicken teriyaki (simple enough, right?) and I was pretty unimpressed. The amount of chicken was very poor, just laid on top of a heaping bed of rice. The chicken itself was very chewy, lacked flavor, and seemed overcooked. Also there wasn't very much sauce on it at all! I really don't know how you mess up chicken, rice, and sauce, but I was unimpressed and confused given the raving reviews here. Maybe it was just an off night, but I probably wouldn't return.",

I think it might've cooled it down faster. I think the portion size of the bbq stick also contributes to how fast it cooled down. The warmers on the tables are fueled by candles underneath the plate. You order on a sheet of paper while sitting at the table kind of like dtf and the server takes it. There are pictures on the wall to help reference what your options are. They do have rice bowl dishes, dumplings and noodles but we ordered the chicken, beef, fish tofu, and garlic mushroom sticks. They were small and not filling but the golden fried bread helped supplement my appetite. The chicken stick was my fave. It was thicker than the other bbq and was really juicy.

Upon first entry, I was rather lost, for our waitress did not speak any English. While I do not feel that this should be negative in itself, it is rather difficult as a foreigner to Chinese culture to be a customer. There appears to be traditional Chinese food, but the unique aspect of this restaurant is perhaps the odd-contraption of aluminum foil heated by candles (?). It is not very effective for heating the skewers and seems rather silly. The food flavor was not terrible, but I would have rather gone somewhere else with the cost of the money that I paid. Overall, I do not recommend coming to this restaurant. The food is not terrible, but you should probably go somewhere else. The caveat is that this is a relatively new place, and it may improve.",

I saw the rectangular grill on the table and was excited that we would be able to cook the skewers ourselves but that was not the case. What actually happens is that they cook the meat for you and then place it on the grill box to keep warm. This would have been okay if 1) the skewers were served hot and 2) the grill actually kept them hot. I expected the skewers to be piping hot coming from the kitchen but I was surprised at how lukewarm they were, which suggests that the meat wasn't cooked long enough or the skewers weren't fresh. The grill was kind of a sham because it didn't use coal but TEA LIGHT CANDLES to produce heat.

My friends and I got our first order in 30 ish min, but after another 30 minutes (making a total of 1 hour wait time) the rest of our order has not arrived.The menus are not consistant with each other, we ordered a rack of lamb Â thinking we would be getting 6 pieces based on the image of the formal menu (not the ordering menu, ordering menu is just where you put how many of certain items you want) for 10 dollars. We only got one piece. One piece for 10 bucks. Brought it up with the owner and the best he would do was to make it only 5 bucks, not in the mood to argue I agreed.I think the only reason why my table got our food after that 1 hour wait was because I complained to the waitstaff and didn't risk a mistake through language barrier by complaining in mandarin. Waited a long time to have a great chinese bbq place and was hella excited to come here. I'm willing to wait for another better place to open up cuz i'm not coming back here again",

The female was friendly and smiled, and even double checked to see that I had been served. My take-out order was completed promptly.Food: Blah. Not bad just nothing special. Standard pho broth and definitely not in the category of being one of my favorites.

I'm pretty sure I exceed my sodium intake for the day because of this meal. I only added a small drop of the hoisin sauce and immediately regretted it.. which sucks because I wanted to drink the beef broth to feel better. The one star goes to the banh mi - it was plentiful, flavorful, and delicious. The pork was soft and not too fatty.Could this have been an off day?",

Lots of meat inside -- but not the traditional cuts you'd expect in a bun no hue -- definitely more cheaper meatball. Extremely extremely filling though -- great student fare to keep you full.Waiters and cashiers are a bit surly. I guess this is on account of being tip optional.

It was conveniently located on the Ave, although parking is kind of difficult (street parking only!). There is also a good amount of seats in the restaurant. I've been here probably around 10 times now, during lunch and dinner, and never really had to wait to be seated.The pho here is really cheap and good. I normally get a small brisket pho, since the large bowls are actually HUGE and I can't finish one of those. Â For only $6.50, that is usually enough to fill me up. However, if you want to split this into multiple meals, the large is only a dollar extra ($7.50) and that can easily cover two meals. The service here is pretty fast, and the pho comes steaming hot in a plastic bowl. The broth is savory and rich, and there is a decent amount of Â meat in the bowl. It basically tasted like exactly what you would expect. The brisket is also quite tender and there are not a lot of tendons. The noodles themselves were pretty average-- it just tasted like what rice noodles were supposed to taste like.Although this place is just a simple casual restaurant and there's not much to write home about, it's a very solid option for pho in the Seattle area, and probably the best value on the west side.

With new industry trends in bubble tea and plentiful competition how does Mee Sum stay in business? By consistently having great food and drinks. So I need to talk about the drink selection, they have all your standard choices of both tea and fruit flavors. But the king of drinks here is their Japanese Milk Tea. It is very similar to royal milk tea but I have never and I mean NEVER found something like this drink in a different bubble tea shop. For all I know Mee Sum is the only one on The Ave selling this delicious elixir. If you havent tried it out yet you are missing out! Food is primarily Taiwanese with some notable exceptions, I was very impressed with their fish sauce chicken wings and their pork sauce over rice is insanely cheap, if you are looking for a good quick lunch get that with a Japanese Milk Tea and you will be all set!",

Another friend recommended this place to us and we thought we would come try it out.First off, parking on the Ave is really hard. There were barely any parking spaces, and street parking was difficult because there were a lot of cars going around on University Ave. We got to the restaurant around 6:45 PM, and we were able to get a table without any difficulty. The server gave us menus, so we can look at them before going up to the counter to order. They have a bunch of different dishes-- chicken, beef, pork, and seafood. They had Taiwanese cuisine, as well as Hong Kong and Chinese dishes.At the counter, there were a lot of Asian style buns on the counter. I was really tempted to get one, but the $2.25 price tag was really high. After some deliberation I decided to get the crispy chicken wings dinner, since I love Chinese fried chicken and I haven't been able to find a place that served them. The guy at the counter who took our order was super cool. He suggested some dishes for my friend, and told me that the fried chicken would take a bit longer than the other dishes (around 10 min).The food came out really fast (with the exception of the wings, but that's expected), with soup and rice as sides. The soup had mushrooms and tofu in it, and it was light, savory, and delicious.Special shout out here to our server, who was fast, provided good service, and was hilarious. He explained to us what each dish was, except for one of them-- he didn't know what it was called. However, he explained to us that he just finished finals and his brain was elsewhere! Being fresh college grads ourselves, we know that feeling all too well. HAHAHA, somebody please give this guy a pay raise.When I got my fried chicken, it first looked and smelled so good, that I forgot to take pictures and just started eating right away! That really speaks to how appetizing the food is, because I always take pictures of my food. The wings were crispy, well-seasoned, and juicy. They were also really hot because they were freshly fried! The meat inside was all fully cooked, and its tenderness contrasted nicely with the crispy exterior. I inhaled all 5 wings in under 10 minutes, and proceeded to inhale half the broccoli (was a little bit hard but still good) and half the rice (topped with meat so it was savory!). I ended up taking the rice and broccoli home, so I could save it for another meal. When we left, I forgot my phone on the table. When we called the number, our server picked up and let us know that he had the phone, and that we can go back to pick it up. Mee Sum is a place with excellent food and even better service, and I'd be happy to come back again, over and over again.",

    "review": "Last night my friends & I went to Mee Sum for dinner. I went with their popcorn chicken meal in which for a simple meal, still brought out a great presentation. Being presented with the fried boneless chicken, garnished with basil, accompanied with a side of rice & salad, I was excited to try what this meal had to offer.Going for the salad first, it was nothing spectacular. It had to be one of my least favorite salad I ever had, but it is merely an add-on that should not have a heavy weight in reviewing this dish.Moving on to the most important part, the popcorn chicken with rice, definitely upholds the entire dish. The flavor in the popcorn chicken is rich, and is complimented immensely with the basil. Even eating the basil itself packs a wonderful flavor. Biting into the chicken feels as if the breading and meat just explodes in your mouth, leaving nothing but flavor in your taste buds. Accompanied with the rice that has different toppings used to garnish, it is a great combination especially for a college student needing a break during the week.",

There was one server that just pretty much ruin the restaurant. First, she didn't have patience and she wasn't so nice. It feels like she's in a hurry to go home. Well that was alright cause it was just a quick moment. Second, we forgot to take our order number and she came to us with a bad attitude, she didn't throw it at us but she didn't put it nicely either. After she left, my friend was like what makes her so pissed?? Third, we saw her talking to other customers v rude. Fourth, I understand Mandarin and she talked to her co-worker in Mandarin that \"Why are there so many people during dinner time? I want to eat dinner.\" I was like hmmmm, you are at work and all you do is complaining, just go back home. The food is good, I would like to try more. Their meal included a small bowl of tofu soup. I would go back for the food not the server's bad attitude tho!",

It is still crispy and tasty but not really out there. Haven't really had any issues over the few times I've been here and their pork belly over rice always does justice for me. Consistency is key and they seem to have that pretty pat down for these items.Even though it's not really a milk tea specific shop, I would say they have one of the better milk teas in the area though I generally go for the more artificial flavored ones like taro or coconut.It's not generally crowded from what I have experienced and a decent option if you don't feel like waiting too long. Ordered online once before and had it delivered and it came fine.Don't forget to get a stamp card with your milk tea!",

They also have dozens of bubble tea options - I tried the mango and was impressed with the quality. I have been enjoying their baos for many many years and am so happy I don't have to go all the way to Pike Place to get them (although I think they still make them there and just cart them up, so if you want to get them as fresh as possible you still need to go downtown.)

I would give the food three stars; it's on the cheaper side and hits the spot when you're craving Asian comfort food. I've ordered the deluxe pork belly over rice and pineapple BBQ pork fried rice. The deluxe pork belly is flavorful and juicy and comes with a lot of rice. There's also a hard-boiled egg that comes with the dish that is really good. I feel like they don't give you as much quantity when you order to-go, though. The pineapple BBQ fried rice tastes a little plain. The pineapple flavor isn't very strong, but they give you an insane amount of rice! My friend got chicken wings and thought they were amazing, so I'll definitely have to give them a try next time. Service here is also very good. It seems like most of the staff are students and they'll be completely upfront and honest with you when you ask for their recommendations or opinions.

Which, was a lovely and generous gesture...I mentioned I was staying at the hotel up the street but thankfully I was visiting colleagues later that day, so they didn't go to waste.When I got back to my hotel, I was met with a hefty bagel sandwich, that, I thought would be half pastrami on one half and half pastrami on the other, but she basically just doubled up the meat on both sides (which makes way more sense). It was a shit ton of meat and I don't know if that's because she was feeling like giving away the farm or if that's the actual amount of meat this bagel sandwich normally has on it. It was something you'd see on a poster, not real life. I scarfed down the first half and needed to lay horizontal after. It was beautiful but a lot...in a good way. There was Russian dressing and cheese and the bagel did a good job of holding it all together.I ate the next half the following day and while it didn't necessarily hold up (as expected with all those fresh ingredients on it), it was still a messy, delightful sandwich.

I got \"Donald's Favorite\" which is mixing Turkey, coleslaw, with russian dressing and Swiss which reminds me a lot of the amazing Cole-Turkey sandwich I am used to in Las Vegas from a shop called Capriotti's. I am also not a fan of bacon, but for some reason the way the bake it into the bagel works great for the texture and added fatty/salty flavor. I ordered through Amazon Daily Dish, but I will definitely have to visit the restaurant to partake in the heavenly sounding \"Ducks in a Row\" (which adds Roast and Corned beef to the Donald favorite) and will be bringing my hog dog loving, New York friend when he visits for the Bagel Dogs.Might have just been a one-time thing, but I also really appreciated them throwing in a few Pepperoni Pizza bagels in my to-go order.

I got the hot cocoa and the tiramisu cake and the total was about $12, so a bit on the pricier end. That being said, the tiramisu was soooo creamy and had the perfect amount of coffee. The hot cocoa was provided in a large steaming mug. The table we sat at contained letters and scraps of poetry, which added to the homey ambiance of the cafe.

Pretty typical of places in this neighborhood, but wouldn't be a go-to place for me to study/meet/hang out. I grabbed coffee to go both times, once in the afternoon and once in the morning, and both times felt a bit claustrophobic and eager to be on my way.The coffee is REALLY good, though. And they have oat milk!",

From almond milk lattes to americanos, my espresso drinks are always delicious and never burnt or over-extracted.

The baristas are always pleasant, and while this isn't always the best place to stop if I'm in a huge rush, the wait is always reasonable.

Employees are always friendly and quick with your orders, with a smile on their face as well (not something you really find everywhere). Their snack type foods are also good if you're looking for a quick bite. Prices are comparable with other places in the area. The interior is a bit small in size but is quite charming and quirky. Not much of the interior matches but it matches the vibe of the coffee house. Good luck finding a place to sit though, it's consistently packed.

To begin with there's construction going on outside, which makes the overall experience of just getting in hectic! And if you come during lunch time... good luck. There's not much seating considering it is a small CafÃ©! Majority of the staff are college students, who don't necessarily make you feel welcome when you come...sadly. However, as of the quality of the beverages and food... you can never go wrong with any drink purchased whether it be an americano, green tea lattes, white mocha, or the occasional lavender ice tea (one of my favs)!! Hot beverages often come with a small design which is always nice! However for the food it honestly depends on the time of a day.. if you come when it's busy your food will probably be cold but in the early mornings or afternoon it's almost always perfect! I recommend the Belgium waffles, grilled cheese, and the California BLT!P.s. one of my favorite things about this cafe is the tables and how people are able to leave notes beneath the glass!

I enjoyed eating it, but I felt like there was just a little bit too much carrot, and I wish it had been cut in half.

With a bunch of other coffee shops in the area, this is a cute coffee shop that is most likely a Korean coffee shop as there were a couple of march with Korean characters. The overall coffee shop also had a more Asian coffee shop feel, which is good thing! There are a decent amount of seating in the cafe, but with it located in a university town, expect lots of students studying in the cafe. However, most of them are nice enough to let you share tables with them, so just ask! They had a decent amount of selections, with standard coffee items like latte and also more unique items like the earl grey latte. My friends and I ended up getting a matcha latte and an earl grey latte for drinks and a Belgium waffle to share. Overall I think the drinks and food were great, except for one small thing - there's a bit too much sugar. While I had no issues with my hot matcha latte, my friend's earl grey latte probably had way too much syrup. We both felt like we would get sugar high off of it. Same thing with the Belgium waffle, while it looked amazing, there were way too much syrup drizzled over it for my liking. I felt like my waffle was getting drenched in the syrup on top of also having powder sugar already on it. Despite having way too much sugar, I still like the feel of the cafe, and would definitely still recommend it. I would just recommend people ask for less syrup when they order certain items unless you are someone who really likes to have a lot of sugar/syrup.",

I personally prefer a fizzier funkier booch but it was decent. I did enjoy my healthy, flavorful bowl. The portion size is a reasonable amount. I could have finished it but didn't want to stuff myself so I took the rest to go. My friends seemed to enjoy their Grilled Kim-Cheese (~$10) and Burrito + smoothie.

    "review": "Man I would love to get this place a better rating... I've been a regular for over three years and I think it's finally time Â to write a review. Unfortunately I would have to say my number one complaint about this place is actually the incredibly slow service. There has never been a time that I have come and the food has come out quickly. No matter what time of day or how busy. I frequently try to call ahead to order food due to the slow service and they almost never pick up the phone... which honestly makes it that much more disappointing that there is no way around the slow service. A few years ago I figured it was a result of being a young business. I assumed they were still learning how to staff their restaurant correctly and learn efficient systems for getting quicker service. I think it's been very disappointing to see no improvement... And even worse no apology or acknowledgment. Yikes Second biggest complaint is not their fault but parking in their area is terrible. I highly recommend parking on the side of the street that has the YMCA. Third biggest complaint is the high cost. I make organic vegan food at home all the time and it cost nowhere near what they charge for some things. Now for the good stuff! I have always loved that this restaurant has wonderful morals, ethically sourced food, great quality, unique fun recipes, and tasty food!I love their selection of chai, their beers on tap, their siders, and absolutely love their raw desserts!If you can find parking, and have the time and money I would say it is worth going for sure!!! A few things I absolutely used to love about this place was that they had what was called the community bowl where you could purchase it based on what you could afford which I just thought was such a generous idea!! They also used to have a pay it forward program where you could purchase a future coffee and stick it on a board for a homeless person to come and redeem! I'm not sure if they still have the community bowl but I know they don't have the pay it forward program anymore which is disappointing.I have always thought that the decor was unique and interesting and I love that they usually have lots of plants! I can tell that they are trying but in my opinion also failing so many areas... sorry broad fork. I will keep coming back but maybe only for a little while longer and only a couple times a year.",

I'm like woah, this place looks familiar. Pretty sure I interviewed here once.Then I walk closer and this is the old Chaco Canyon! I don't mean to bring up the past but my first impression of CC was so horrible! I waited over 20 minutes for my interview and never got called up... and I ended up leaving. So you can see why I had a bad taste in my mouth as I walked into Broadfork Cafe.However!! This was my first time trying out the food and it seems to be under new management so I decided I will give it a try. I really just wanted to try the \"BBQ Pulled Jackfruit Sandwich\". My love for BBQ Pulled Pork Sandwiches are through the roof and after becoming vegan, I have been on the hunt. I've seen recipes online but I don't have time to cook and as soon as I found out they have it! I was determined to try it.You can guess what I ordered and I dragged along my carnivorous boyfriend with me who ordered the Grilled \"Kim\" Cheeze! Ah, I love grilled cheese sandwiches but kimchi? (I'm also Korean) It sounded very dare-devil like in my opinion! But my boyfriend likes to live on the edge of things so he ordered that! I was starving and I don't know if it's a vegan thing but every vegan place we've gone, food tends to take a wee bit longer to come out! Maybe after 20 minutes have gone by, we are looking around and meet eyes with the staff in the kitchen. A man comes out and apologizes that there was a mix up and they will make it as soon as possible! Luckily, our Â strawberry banana smoothie came out fairly quickly and helped curb the hunger for a bit longer.Afterwards, another person came (the person who took our order prior) and apologizes once more and says we can have dessert or a coffee drink on the house after our meal! Of course, who can say no to VEGAN dessert?Okay, enough about me blabbing. So how was the sandwiches?Uh, frikken delicious?! I mean it's not 100% close to the real deal but as a substitute, I am more than satisfied with replacing pork for the jackfruit look-alike. I ended up throwing the salad into my sandwich because I needed a bit more greens and crunch (from the carrots) and it was perfect.The Kimchi Grilled Cheeze was most definitely interesting... It definitely was I don't know how to explain it, you just have to try it for yourself. I think I liked it but I don't know how often I could order it.",

Unfortunate to hear the negative reviews....I was more than happy and satisfied. Give this place a try. I would absolutely go back again. Â The food is a 5.",

I ordered a plate with crunchy chicken, katsu, and rice.The food was subpar and all of the flavors seemed to blend together of a bland fried, salty taste. This may have been because of all the fried food in retrospect. Furthermore, the ambience and decor is very uninviting and unpleasant and could definitely use an overhaul.Having tried many Hawaiian restaurants around the country including back home in California, as a tourist in Hawaii, and other places here in Washington, unfortunately, I must say that this place is the most disappointing of all Hawaiian restaurants I've tried.

First - the portions are huge, you can easily get two meals out of this, and considering that, it's reasonably cheap. It's also delicious food and great to binge on after a long run or workout (though probably not so healthy). The things that people complain about are the atmosphere at the restaurant, because it looks like it's dead inside and super outdated. I agree, they could do some redecorating, but at the end of the day, the food is great. Most people just get it to go. Another thing to note is it's cash only, but it's on the Ave so there's plenty of ATMs nearby (they used to have one inside I believe, but I don't think they do anymore).

To see a restaurant open nearby that specializes in suancai yu, the restaurant's namesake, really intrigued me!Immediately when you walk in, you notice that this place has a really nicely themed decor. The wallpapers are all well-designed around the idea of their fish. One wall has a giant 9-panel TV that is playing a documentary about where they source their fish. While it may feel a bit out of place, I can't deny it was kinda cute. The way this restaurant is designed definitely reminds me of a newer restaurant that might open up in China, which I really appreciated.Upon being seated, all of the staff there yells \"????\", or \"Welcome\". This may be a bit off-putting at first, and some people might find it uncomfortable, but I honestly found it incredibly endearing! When they bring the food out, the staff also yells \"??\", or \"Food has arrived\", which was just another one of those cute and endearing things.Moving onto the food, we ordered their specialty suancai yu in the small size, and two orders of hongtang ciba, deep-fried rice cake with red sugar syrup. The food came out pretty quickly, and the first thing I want to say about the fish is that despite the small size being recommended for 1-2 people, I felt like it was plenty for the party of three that I came with. The fish is undeniably fresh. The flavor is definitely there; the broth and pickled vegetables definitely do not overpower the fishiness. That being said, there was no real funk to the fish, which made it all the more enjoyable. The fish was sliced into small pieces, and it was thoroughly deboned, meaning that it was very easy to eat the fish, and there wasn't much of a hassle. What I really appreciated, however, was the fact that the broth was just the right strength of flavor. This kind of dish can definitely lean towards the saltier side at many other places, but I think that their aware that the fish and pickled vegetables already give the broth enough of that salty flavor, and so there wasn't much of a need to make it anymore salty. The fish also had a good amount of spice, but nothing that was too much to handle. But with that being said, I can handle spice pretty well, so I may not be very qualified to speak on that aspect.I don't have much to say about the deep-fried rice cake. It was very crispy and crunchy on the outside, the fry was really nice, and the inside was chewy and very mochi-esque. The flavor of the syrup takes a bit of time to really hit. At first, it might just taste like breakfast syrup, but the flavor of the red sugar comes through after a few seconds. Overall, it's a really good way to balance out the sourness and saltiness of the fish!Overall, this place is quite an enjoyable experience. The service here was really nice and attentive, though it definitely helps if you speak Chinese here. Do I think it's a bit overpriced? Yeah, maybe a bit, but I think that the flavor helps me to look past it. I'm super happy to see that there are new, fresh Chinese restaurants opening up in University District, and will definitely come back here to try new things out!",

Two of us ordered a small sauerkraut fish with a side of wild starch noodles and rice. Like most of my friends who came here before, we didn't finish it because the plate was just HUGE. I thought the add-ons are expensive at first but I think it's worth it after seeing how much they actually give you for the price. Our fish was served pretty fast and we were satisfied in general. The service was really nice - our servant introduce their signatures to us, constantly checked how we felt while we were eating and helped us pack the leftover in the end. It's also funny to hear all the staff shout out their slogan once for a while. They start to become busy after 6pm, so come here early if you don't want to wait.

It's unlike anything I've ever tasted (in a good way). The numbing spicy flavor infused with the sourness of the pickled vegetables creates a complex flavor that complements the fish very well. However, its level of spiciness is not for the faint of heart - and there's unfortunately no way to adjust the spiciness. If you have seafood allergies, this is not the place for you, as this fish is the only main entree they serve. We added enoki mushrooms and clear noodles to the fish, which were a nice addition. We also ordered their chicken wings (probably the best of these three), pickled cucumber, and sticky rice cakes as appetizers, none of which were too standout. PRICE:This place is quite expensive, with a medium serving size of the fish costing $50, quoted for 2-3 people. Not somewhere that I would go very often.SERVICE:Service was outstanding. Although the place just opened, staff seemed to have the workflow down very smoothly. We were checked in on often by multiple people, and water was refilled at least four times without being asked. ENVIRONMENT:The restaurant interior is quite nice, with a large TV display combination advertising the restaurant and where the fish comes from. OVERALL:The main dish was great, although will be perceived as quite spicy for some and a bit too pricey to be eating too often.

I believe they also source their fish locally from Washington which is a nice touch. Definitely recommend this place for the food quality and flavor",

We have five people so we ordered a big pot. But with only one fish in it, it feels not much meat. All the other stuff like tofu you put in the pot , they charge extra. The fruit drinks are expensive too, almost $7 each. And they charge you at least 15% tips on top of food and sales tax. Forgot about there is sales tax in WA. Yikes!

It was watery and not creamy at all (the milk to ice cream ratio must've been WAY off what it should be for a creamy milkshake). Both of us were very unimpressed.

It was pretty satisfying with a good amount of blue cheese on. I paired it with sweet potato fries, which were alright but a little too greasy and came with a strangely watery aioli.

Mr Lu's has a lot of options to choose from as far as burgers and chicken sandwiches, which can make it dizzying to try to pin down which burger looks the most appetizing. When I came in this week I got the BBQ burger, a side of waffle fries, and a chocolate shake. The BBQ burger they serve is a simplistic version of what you might see at most other burger joints: it's a patty between two buns with grilled onions and bbq sauce. The quality of the patty and the ingredients/condiments were good, but the burger lacks much substance and isn't super satisfying. I usually like to eat burgers as is in order to have the flavors that the recipe intended, but I should have paid extra in order to add-on cheese and bacon to add something more to this burger. Another note: most burger joints add a crispy element to their BBQ burgers (most often onion rings), which I probably could have asked for as they have onion rings as a side, but I didn't see it explicitly as an option here.The waffle fries were good, and they come along with a fry sauce that is really similar to ranch, which was a positive for me.The chocolate shake was actually somewhat disappointing. It tasted a little too much like vanilla, which is probably a result of not adding enough chocolate syrup to the vanilla ice cream. This could have just been a mistake on the day, but I'll probably pass on the chocolate shake if I return to this restaurant for a second time.Overall, the quality of the ingredients was good as far as the burger and fries are concerned, but the concept of the burger was somewhat mediocre. This restaurant is probably middle of the road for burger joints on the Ave, and unless you find something special on this menu you really like, you're probably better off at one of the other few burger places nearby.",

I've been eyeing The BoB since it opened, and I'm thrilled to be writing a positive review for a place I can see myself returning to again and again.We ordered the steamed dumplings, budae jjigae & gamjatang. The steamed dumplings were a bit disappointing since I don't think they were homemade. They also stuck to the steamer and fell apart whenever we tried to pick them up with our chopsticks, which was a bit of a nuisance. Not a huge deal, since the real stars of the show were the entrees.Both the budae jjigae & gamjatang were SPOT ON for flavor & portion size (huge!!!). We honestly probably could have just split the gamjatang & would have been satiated. They definitely don't skimp here--the gamja tang had 3 (!!!) enormous pork pieces, which is definitely the most generous I've ever seen. We didn't receive side dishes which we found a bit odd after we finished our meal, but honestly since we were SO stuffed, it was a moot point.I do have to say that they do have some operational kinks they need to work out, but nothing egregious. The atmosphere was very awkward since the music was barely audible, causing the restaurant to be so quiet that we felt disruptive for having a conversation at a normal volume. And although the trays are a good idea presentation-wise, we ran out of table space between the appetizer and two entrees. Regardless, I'll definitely be back and would recommend if you're in the mood for some hearty soups/stews!",

BoB features staple Korean dishes from spicy tofu soup (soontofu), bibimbap and more. Asking the owner for her recommendations, we tried the:- Gamja Tang - First time trying individual sized gamja tang! The pork wasn't as \"slide off the bone\" tender as I wanted, but the broth was still flavorful and spicaaay. I appreciated that they didn't skimp and it wasn't just one pork bone, but there were a few within the soup.- LA Kalbi - The marination was actually pretty tasty - just wish it came on a hot plate to stay warm longer! +1 though for creativity on presentation, haha. Prices seem to be fairly standard for Korean food in the area - looking at the menu, soontofu (spicy tofu soup) was around $10, while the more specialty dishes like the LA Kalbi was $16. Overall, our total came out to $30+, which we thought was fairly normal. We also thought the staff working was friendly, offering a refill on the side dishes when we ran out.

By the way, the business was not even on yelp until I manually entered it yesterday and got approved today. Anyways, I was trying to see some reviews on yelp, but the server told me that they are not on yelp yet. He was very happy to provide me recommendations, and was passionate about their food. I love it. We got a Kalbitang (short rib soup) and yukgaejang (spicy beef and vegetable soup). The soup base takes 14 hours to make, and you can taste the delicacy in the soup. Generous portions. Amazing ingredients. Definitely the perfect comfort food for a rainy day in Seattle. Great service. Delicious food. I can see myself come back a lot!And just another random rant (don't take me too seriously), when your food is good, you don't need much effort to attract customers. Later this week when I walked by the BoB, the place was almost full. They were not even on Yelp yet! It's funny and a bit pathetic when other businesses try to manipulate the yelp reviews by having their employees write 5-star reviews (*cough*chiglet*cough*).

I've been coming here for the past three years and they have been a consistently reliable restaurant for when my Thai food cravings hit.Today, I ordered a 2 star (note that Little Thai uses a spiciness range of 1 to 3 stars) Beef Pad See Ew to go. With tax, the total came out to $10.95 (much more reasonable than Noodle Nation). Personally, I thought the 2 Star was really mild and ended up adding my own chili paste when I got home... However, I've Â gotten a 3 Star Spicy Drunken Noodles before, and that was very hot, so I guess it depends on the dish.Like most Thai restaurants, portions are small for the price. However, the noodles were flavorful and not overly sweet or greasy. I wish that they included more vegetables, but it was enough to complement the noodles. As far as service goes, the owner is very friendly and will also give you recommendations. Her favorite dish is apparently the Spicy Thai noodles which she describes as wide noodles with a sour and savory chili sauce. Ive never had it before, but I'll have to give it a go next time! They are also quick, at least for takeout orders; I was in and out of the restaurant in less than 15 minutes.Overall, Little Thai's selection of food is more than enough to satisfy the taste buds of both the average and adventurous Thai food lovers.

For meat, I got the braised intestines, braised rib, and pig feet, and all were great. The pig feet in particular was super tender.

If you're not sure what toppings to choose, I'll do my best to describe some of the ones I've had!Braised pork intestine - this one is def something not everyone is keen on trying due to texture and just the idea of eating intestine, but it's squishy and someone has a creamy/fatty taste to it. It also smells a bit fermented but like I said, it's delicious if you're into this stuff!Pork tongue - I usually like tongue, but for this place the tongue kinda tasted like trees (I don't eat trees) or cardboard. I've had it multiple times and it's always tasted like that. Maybe that's just what pork tongue taste like. Braised pork ribs - Tender, soft, and braised well! Would recommend this to those who aren't adventurous enough to try the above toppings I've talked about! Fresh cut fish - I always get this one because of how soft and tender the fish is. It's clean and I like the light salty taste of it. I should try the other items on their menu but I just really like their noodle bowls hehehe.",

The other one was the super noodle combo with the Thai Tom yam, boiling egg, instant noodles, spam, five spicy beef, braised rib, mushroom, bak choi, and fresh tofu with green onions and cilantro. The original spicy broth was not too spicy but good overall. The Thai Tom yam was slightly tangy and not spicy at all considering it had a chili pepper on the menu.

If you want the egg, it would definitely be worthwhile to upgrade to the super noodle combo (normally +$1.50 for an egg). Otherwise, the regular one should suffice!

I ordered the spicy Sichuan soup with rice noodles, sliced beef, tofu sheets, enoki mushrooms, and bean sprouts. The main complaint that I have is that the soup lacks depth of flavor; it just tastes like water, a little bit of salt, and spicy oil. As a result, the ingredients in the soup were also pretty bland. There was also only 3 pieces of meat in the whole bowl. Overall, it was decently filling for the price, but it isn't really anything special.",

It's actually pretty good! I didn't expect the popcorn chicken! However it's a little bit pricy to me. I would want it as a appetizer but here the price is an entree price but with no rice. Only the popcorn chicken for $10.99. Even tho the size is bigger then usual $6 popcorn chicken from other bubble tea place, but still for popcorn chicken I would want smaller portion and the price as appetizer! The noodle soup is also good! I ordered the Szechuan spicy soup base with pork tongue!! They have pork tongue! I love pork tongue and it's really hard to find in Seattle. And the I picked udon noodle which is the Japanese style Udon! I really like Japanese style Udon! The noodle soup is also $10.99 with 3 pick of meat,3 pick of vege and one egg! Ok price. Overall I enjoyed the meal!",

My friend stepped closer to the kitchen and asked if anyone was there and the server said, \"Give me just a minute please.\"We proceeded to look through the menu on the tablet at the table, ordered our food, and paid via tablet. The waiter comes over and asks if we are ready to order and I state that we already ordered via the tablet.BE CAREFUL WHEN YOU ORDER VIA TABLET, it will automatically select \"upgrade to large\" for drinks and add +$1 to your total.He then takes about 15 minutes to make our drinks. He comes back with a blueberry fruit tea and I said I ordered a peach and he said, \"You said blueberry,\" and so I had to take it - he offered no alternatives. The food arrives and the \"xiao long bao\" were utterly disappointing at a whopping cost of $10 for 3. My friend's dragon wonton dumpling was spicy even though she marked non-spicy. My shredded cold noodles were also spicy and I marked non-spicy as well. As we sat there and dined, the waiter was at another watching a video on his phone.I picked up some of the chopsticks and pull it out of the sleeve and they were USED. Also, if you pay via tablet, there is an automatic charge of 15% tip.My friends all said the food was bland and very unimpressionable. We will not be coming back. Our total cost for 2 drinks and 1 breakfast item, 1 noodle dish was $53.When we left the place, my friend mentioned \"no wonder they offer a $5 off coupon code for a 5-star review.\" The menu is impressive and the order-via-tablet was a novel idea and would be efficient if they restaurant was run better on a whole.",

    "review": "I came here for dinner tonight expecting this place to be Yinzi's Kitchen, but surprise! It's now called Panda Master, still serving Chinese food but of a different variety. (Yinzi's served mainly Szechuan food; not sure exactly what Panda is, but it's not the same style according to one of the waitresses who who works there.)This place is located in the same location as the old Yinzi's, literally to the right of the 21+ AMC theater in U-Distirct; the sign for Yinzi's is even still up. From the outside, the only indication that the restaurant is now Panda Master comes from the paper signs posted on the windows.Atmosphere: The restaurant wasn't too crowded when we went. There were maybe one or two other tables seated for the duration of our meal. Pretty quiet and peaceful.Food: If you're looking for good Chinese food, this is it! We tried the xiaolongbao, braised beef noodle, white dumplings, and liquid/solid custard buns -- all delicious! My boyfriend had the pork noodle with chili oil, which was also pretty yummy according to him. If you order one of the the noodle soups, they provide the option of extra noodles for free, as long as you can finish them (not finishing is a $3 extra charge).Heads up -- if you're expecting the xiaolongbao to be like Din Tai Fung with the soupy interior and soft skin, Panda's xiaolongbao aren't like this. They're more of the mainland China variety, i.e. not soupy and with a tougher interior. Same with their dumplings. Still delicious, though.Price: Okay, this was the only sticky point. For two people, we spent $46 with tax before tip. The food was great and I was pretty full when we were finished, but if you're looking for a cheap eat, this isn't it. The priciest thing we ordered were the white dumplings, which were around $12 for the bowl. For the quantity, I'm not sure if I would order it again.Service: This is what really stood out to me. The service we received was incredibly attentive and friendly. Multiple times we were asked how the food was, whether we needed anything, water refills, etcetera. One of the waitresses gave us one of her recommendations (custard buns!) which turned out to be delicious. There were also some things on the menu in Chinese that I couldn't read, so the waitress translated for us. We were very impressed.Other comments: Their menu at the moment is on an iPad -- not sure if this is going to be permanent? (It seemed like they only have one iPad for the whole restaurant, but I could be wrong on this.) We selected menu items through the iPad, and then the waitress came and confirmed our order. The system had some kinks, e.g. the iPad didn't seem fully responsive at times and some items were only listed in Chinese, but nothing too major. Also, the receipt was solely in Chinese, so if you don't know the language too well (like me), it might be worth asking for a translation.Overall: What a great find! Despite Panda being a little pricy (essentially the primary con), I will definitely be a repeat customer.",

In short: inefficient ordering system, mediocre service, extremely poor value (small portions and pricey), and food safety concerns (spoons had stickers on them). Keep in mind that some of us are quite familiar with Sichuan cuisine.First, our group was handed two tablets, which they said was the menu. We passed it around so everyone could take a look, but nobody told us how to order. The server was very busy, so we tried to use the tablet to order and pay, but it didn't work. It took about 20 mins just for everyone to read off 2 tablets, and then have the server to explain that we're supposed to order (but not pay) using the tablets. So, basically not able to split checks.Good thing the food came out quickly, because it took so long to get the server's attention and order. Most of the noodle and dumpling dishes (eg ???/???/??) were around $12-14 before tax. But they were SO SMALL. Nobody was full after one portion! The worst part was the ??? (sour spicy rice noodles) did not have minced meat, it was $13 for just the noodles - that's not how it's meant to be. Flavour wise, the spicy beef noodles and sour spicy rice noodles were ok, but still doesn't warrant the priciness. We weren't given utensils, so we got our own chopsticks, soup spoons and napkins from a table by the kitchen. Before you use the soup spoons, CHECK IF THERE'S A STICKER ON THE BOTTOM. At least 3 of us got spoons with a sticker on it. Eww! All in all, a lot of red flags about this place. I recommend the business improves on the price/portion issues, the food safety issues (eating glue is unacceptable), and the ordering system. We will not be back after this terrible experience though.",

We were given sunflower seeds as a free snack (which were really good!) and our food came promptly. I ordered the spicy beef noodles which had the right amount of kick to it. If you're looking for good Szechuan food this is the place! I think their menu is supposed to be more snack/quick meal oriented so keep that in mind. Interestingly they have game rentals available (mahjong, go, etc.) and price it by hourly use. We didn't use this service but it sounded interesting!Overall we enjoyed a quality and speedy service and delicious food.

I don't usually go out of my way for these joints but my girl be hungry, this restaurant was nearby, and we wanted hamburgers and fries. Tried the hand cut garlic fries first, whoowee they were bomb! Topped with fresh parmesan and mama lil peppers, the fries were slightly spicy(flavorful not hot), very savory, and had some tang from the peps. Good place to start. My lady and I each ordered an entree and shared cause we cute like that. I ordered the bison shepard's pie, and she had the cowboy burg with the impossible patty substitute and sweet tato fries. We were pleasantly surprised by the portions for the price. Shep's pie was creamy, hearty, flavorful, and the bison was tender n moist. Oh and healthy, there were kale bites to make your body happy along with your taste buds. Full disclosure, we never had the impossible burger patty but have tried alternatives like field roast vegan patties. Field roast patties are good but they don't even compare to the quality in flavor or texture of the impossible patty. The burger really bleeds! Just like the rumors. It is honestly the most authentic vegan meat substitute we have come across that actually taste like meat. This burger patty is a must try for anyone, not just an option for your vegan or vegetarian friends. You can ask for no bacon or cheese on the burg to make it vegan certified. But if you choose to get bacon, be happy they load you up with four big n smokey delicious stripes! The condiments were all fresh and the sweet tatos were a generous helping. I ordered The Redemption cocktail, their rendition of the classic Old Fashioned. The drink was balanced, which is always how I gauge a good drink. Citrus notes complimented the whiskey( I chose high rye but you have the option between normal rye n classic whiskey) the bitters added herbaceous n spicy notes that were subtle from the light sweetness of the drink. Not sure if they use simple syrup or muddle a sugar cube but the flavors were all well maintained. We should have taken some pictures because everything was served beautifully. Too busy enjoying the food in the moment I guess. The service was exceptional. Our waters were always full and we had everything we needed before having to ask.

I usually stay at the bottom end of Lake Union, good eats there, but on this job we decided to stay up in the University District closer to our port. Since we are mostly Marriott regulars, there was not much choice.The T12 is located adjacent to the Marriott and since the hotel does not technically have a restaurant, this place covers that. The menu is somewhat eclectic. Some Asian, some pub-grub, all around good for a casual meal. The wings are good, burger too, and the grilled cheese is excellent.Service is important to me, so I have to compliment Kanoe and Kiley.Have to say, if you are down-town or in Ballard there are loads of places to choose from.

We ordered two whiskey sours ($5 during happy hour), soft pretzels, cheese quesodilla, french fries. The food had no flavor. It tasted like we were eating cardboard. The pretzels were rock hard, a basic cheese quesodilla anyone could make, Â and the fries tasted just like fast food fries. On to the drinks. These were all sour no whiskey. It was obvious they were watered down. They were hard to drink, as to how sour they were. I paid $34 for cardboard food and watered down drinks. Will not be returning.",

    "review": "Worst experience I've had at a restaurant in a very long time! We were guests in the hotel upstairs that T12 is a part of, (Marriot Residence Inn), and thought it would be a convenient place to come for a bite. Â We had kids in our group of about 12, and some of them really wanted ice cream.First, the good. Â The food that we got was honestly really good, and they have a great selection of beer. Just be prepared to wait a very...long...time.Food was extremely slow coming out. And one of the slowest things to come out? The ice cream!! They don't do anything special to it, mind you; it's a single, smallish scoop in a little bowl. But after AN HOUR, the kids were all still waiting for their ice cream. Meanwhile, drinks and other plates had trickled out at a glacial pace. And whenever our waiter was asked where stuff was, he acted as if we were stupid for asking. He just oozed a complete disdain for all of us. When we pointed out that an hour was a pretty ridiculous amount of time for someone to scoop ice cream, he even mocked us saying, \"Why don't we all just get mad at each other.\" Seriously??? There was NEVER an apology or empathy or serious attempt to make things right. He just kept saying that the \"kitchen had the tickets\" and he didn't know what the issue was. Â (It's worth pointing out here that neither the restaurant or the bar were at ALL busy...the place was really chill.) Â When they FINALLY brought the meager scoops of ice cream out, at least one of the kids still didn't get theirs. When asked about that, the waiter said \"Oh yeah...we don't have that flavor.\" And remember, this is after an hour!! There was other food that never did make it to the table, but at that point we were all so angry about the discourteous and disrespectful service and ready to leave that it was too late.A couple things. I recognize that large groups like ours was can be extra challenging to wait on. But there are PLENTY of waitstaff that not only do this aptly, but in a way that makes me want to come back to your establishment. It isn't rocket science. Furthermore, a family of 3 in our group had come to the restaurant by themselves another time and said the service had been no better then; still good food, but incredibly slow and served by people who couldn't care less about you.I'm an easygoing guy. I've been known to let all sorts of things slide. I don't send things back to the kitchen. I prefer to be polite in all situations and I love to tip generously. So believe me when I say that if I'M mad, it was really bad. This was truly one of the most awful and frustrating experiences I've had in an establishment in years and years, and it ruined our evening. Wouldn't go back if you paid me.",

This place has a plethora of tvs and a projector and would be great for games. They can also seat large groups, I'm sure, with advance notice. With 30+ beers on tap, I was disappointed by the fact that they had only one dark rotating seasonal available. The rest of the beer list offered mostly lighter beers and a handful of pale ales. Regardless, it's a cool environment with dartboards, shuffleboard, and a foosball table. Service was awkward but fast (it seemed like they had way more servers than necessary, and most were young probably college students from the area). All items on their happy hour menu were $5 each. We got the Taiwanese salt and peppered wings and the stadium nachos. The wings were hot, fresh, and cooked to perfection. Unfortunately, they were lacking seasoning despite their name. The nachos were typical but I was particularly impressed by how craftily the fresh jalapeÃ±os were deseeded so that there was a never a bite that was too spicy. The burgers coming out of the kitchen appeared to be pretty small. I'd like to come back to try more happy hour items including the almond crusted calamari. Price point is a little high for the area otherwise, but it seems like a fun, safe, and place to grab a beer in the area.",

This is NOT THE PLACE FOR YOU.I wanted to be spontaneous so I asked the waitress for the most popular dish on the vegetarian menu. The waitress suggested V17: Stir fried tofu in lemongrass sauce served w/ rice vermicelli noodle & fresh vegetables. When I received the dish, it did have each component listed on the menu. However, the noodles were over cooked, and the vegetables were in really large pieces; making it more difficult to eat. I told the waitress I did not like the dish and asked kindly if I could choose something else. She said I could not change the order that \"she suggested\" and that I would have to pay for the meal - even though I could not eat it due to the large pieces of food and over cooked noodles.When it was time to pay I walked passed a shorter woman with short, straight black hair. She was smiling and I thought she was being kind - and maybe she was not aware of my order situation. So, I asked her if I have to pay for a meal I could not eat. The short woman in charge told me, that if it was something wrong on their part, it could be refunded. But because it wasn't their fault, I had to pay for the meal because she would lose money if she complied each time a person requests an order change. I mean, if people are requesting order changes for dishes, doesn't that signal a problem? If your losing money; it's because of a reason. And that reason is an opportunity to improve your business. But when you just take a customers money without delivering a quality meal, that is selfish, uncaring and self-serving.Ensuring customer satisfaction is important for a business that wants to stay in business. Unfortunately, their execution with the large pieces of food and poor service of not caring for their customer is where they lost me. Also, her disrespectful laugh when I told her the waitress suggested the meal was rude and uninviting.Although she must had known they had some responsibility in the matter. The food is not well proportioned. There is no love at this restaurant for VEGETARIANS. This is NOT THE PLACE FOR YOU.I get that they have been there a long time, but times change and the menu items do not, it is important to ensure quality.My meal was not made with quality, care, or love. You want to know what I think is authentic food? When someone makes their dishes with pride. When a meal is made with pride, it is made with quality ingredients, prepared well, and with love. I found none of the sort at this restaurant. Their execution was poor, the woman in charge is rude, and they don't care about customer service.",

    "review": "Another day, another Uber Eats meal. My wife and I tried several different smaller items on the cheaper side rather than going with entrees. Here's what we got:Hu Tiu Xao Chay (Tofu and vegetable stir-fry): I got this dish primarily because I was craving a lot of veggies so I was kinda disappointed that this dish was dominated by a ton of rice noodles. The veggies you see in the pic were about it--- all on top. This dish also could've used a bit more flavor. I ended up adding some soy sauce to kick it up a bit. I wouldn't order again.Chao Gio Chay (Egg rolls): These were delicious. Not much else to add except that they had a lot of flavor, were fried perfectly, and the dipping sauce took it over the top. Wish they could've added more for $6 though :)Golden Rice Balls (Fried sweet rice balls stuffed with pork): I'm still a bit torn on these. I was hoping that the saltiness of the pork would be equivalent to the sweetness of the rice.... but this dish was much sweeter than I expected and was almost akin to a dessert. I couldn't taste the pork at all. However, I really enjoyed the crunchy outer texture and the gummy texture on the inside. I probably wouldn't buy these again but would eat them if I got them for free haha.Chicken Banh Mi: This sandwich was excellent. This was my first banh mi even though I've been wanting to try one forever. The bread was perfectly fresh and the chicken was grilled perfectly. The diced veggies inside complimented the chicken. Ga Nuong Cuon Xa (Lemongrass chicken skewers): Similar to the chicken in the banh mi, this chicken was grilled perfectly. The flavor was amazing and I could eat these skewers all day.Overall, we enjoyed the meal and would definitely go back again. I also appreciated that they provided a ton of napkins, utensils, and even individual packets of hot sauce and hoisin sauce. Lastly, they are pretty fast in preparing the food.",

For the flavor and taste I could only taste the spiciness and sauce but I was still satisfied. Bottom line: Good traditional korean restaurant that's cheap. Service: Came in during 4-5 pm so was not very busy. Employees are nice and chill.",

    "review": "Great place to go if you want a lot of food at an affordable price!Went here a couple of days ago to get some Korean tofu soup. I ordered the mixed tofu soup, and it came out quickly. Make sure you don't burn your tongue because it comes out piping hot. The server would plop a fresh egg into the boiling soup, so make sure to cover the egg with the tofu and other things in the soup to cook it enough. The mixed soup included beef, shrimp, and clams. However, the majority of it was tofu with 1 shrimp, 2 clams, and some sprinkling of beef. The soup was way too salty for my liking, and I got so full from eating the rice to balance out the saltiness.They also had a good amount of side dishes. The server brought out kimchi, bean sprouts, fish cakes, braised potatoes, and some chopped up green onion pancakes. You can tell these dishes came out from large batches because they weren't that fresh. The green onion pancakes were especially staler and cold.Service was not the best, but it's understandable because there were only 2 servers for a packed restaurant. I'd like to come back to try bibambop or bulgogi.",

Be warned though- this place fills up quickly even during off hours!Their banchan (included appetizers) includes honey potato, kimchee, bean sprouts, fish cake, and green onion pancake. My favorite is the fish cake. Note: they will also give you banchan if you order takeout!My favorite dishes here are the Toppokki and the Jap Chae. The Toppokki (cylindrical rice cakes) have a similar texture to mochi and are served in a super spicy and red Korean sauce. The dish also has a little bit of beef bulgogi, onions, and lettuce. Traditionally it is served with ramen on top (+$1), but I prefer mine without the extra noodles. The purple rice is complementary and is an absolute must in order to eat this dish.The Jap Chae (sesame oil glass noodles) is enough to serve at least 2-3 people. It has mushrooms, onion, carrots, and pork. It has no spice, so it's perfect for people who don't like the extra heat!",

Korean Tofu House is a nice hole in the wall Korean restaurant specializing in tofu soup right along the Ave.Ambience: It feels pretty Korean, decently clean and tidy. It's not too loud in the restaurant even when busy.Service: Service was, interesting. The servers I've had were great. College kids mostly, one I ended up talking to who picked up the job as a summer gig. However, one server did tell me the manager was complaining that they were serving too many side dishes, which is a major red flag.Food: The food is decent. The prices were actually really fair, better than the other tofu house across the street. My favorite were the side dishes. They have a really tasty pancake dish that my friend and I asked for tons of extras for, as well as the savory potato dish that's pretty rare to find at Korean restaurants nowadays.Overall I've had great experiences eating here and would definitely recommend checking this place out.",

    "review": "Came here on a busy Sunday afternoon. We walked in and luckily a small table for 2 just finished so, we were seated right away. Â The server handed us a menu, although it was one-sided, surprisingly they had quite a selection. Their dishes ranged from spicy tofu soup to Bulgogi to yukgaejang to bibimbap.It was a cold frosty day so we both decided on spicy tofu soup, one pork and the other seafood. We also ordered japche as well. The servers brought us some panchan; kimchi (wasnt done yet), chives pancake (cold and not crispy), sweet potatoes (delish), fish cakes (yum) & bean sprouts (not bad) - 3 stars.After snacking on those side dishes for a few mins, our tofu soups came out bubbling hot. The server also brought out a couple eggs & cracked them right into our stone pot soups. The soup was spicy and delicious! It totally hit the spot - 5 stars!The japche finally came out after a handful of mins. At first, we couldnt really taste anything but more of just a sweetness. Then we realized it's because we have been eating the super flavorful tofu soup so, it made the noodle dish bland in comparison. So, we decided to pack the japche up and try it again later. Sure enough, the japche was definitely tastier the 2nd time around with our palates cleansed and tastes buds back to normal - 5 stars.Overall, I'd give this spot 4 stars. Service was on point and prices were fair. Looking for street parking was no fun. Main dishes were good; the side dishes can use some work. If I am in the area again, I'd like to come back to try other things on their menu.",

Mixed tofu soup, soondubu, is one of my favorite dishes as it really warms the soul. I've had authentic soondubu before in Annandale, NYC, and Seoul. This is by far the saddest soondubu experience I've had unfortunately. The soup didn't come out hot and could barely cook the egg that we cracked into it, although I know some people prefer runny yolk. When my friends and I commented on how lukewarm our soups were, a woman at a neighboring table also chimed in and said she'd observed that too and was glad others agreed. The soup was sadly very watery and thin! The rice (they give purple rice with the soup) is on the stiff side. Side dishes were alright except the pajeon (Korean savory pancake) was straight up cold. But on the plus side, the service here is good. The staff is very friendly and quick to bring banchan refills. Likely won't be coming back here given the experience with the food.",

When we stepped in, there were 4 empty tables but we were told by the female server to wait 15-20 minutes, which I found super baffling. We were just standing there at the door while she walked back to her counter doing stuff. A guy came out from the kitchen area, saw us standing, and approached the female server, seemingly telling her to tend to us and seat us (he was pointing at us while talking). But she shook her head. After 15 minutes wait, the female server came back and seated us at the table right in front of our eyes that had been empty for the past 15 minutes. We were off to not so-good start. Husband was starving, confused, and pissed thinking we could have sat down and were given an extra time to look at the menu while waiting instead of just standing there.We ordered Salmon Sashimi, Eel Roll, Goma Steak, Saba Shioyaki, Rainbow Roll, and Supersonic Roll. The Salmon Sashimi was amazing and fresh. Goma Steak was also really good. My Saba Shioyaki was too salty and a little dry. For the Eel Roll, I didn't really enjoy but I have always been really particular about eels. The other sushi rolls that we ordered were just okay. They weren't bad but not mind-blowing either.

Soon with my takeout bag of goodness in hand, drove back to Shoreline.Tasty, crispy, plump, juicy wings were still hot once arrived at home! Delicious. With tax and tip, this order was under $29. There are other Bok a Bok locations in Burien, White Center, Seattle/Capitol Hill, and now this walk up takeout window in Seattle/University District up at 52nd/UWay with a convenient adjacent tiny parking lot. Hopefully, another one can open in North Seattle or Shoreline. Until then, yay for this site opening. They have ample time to adjust to their new digs before the onslaught of UW students starting end of this month.",

Upon arrival, the order was first come first serve basis and there was only one person in front of me at lunch time. It did not take them that long to make my order which was a 5-piece chicken drumsticks and a side of biscuit drizzled in honey.Personally, I think 5 drumsticks was too much for a person because they were HUUGEE but they were delicious and fairly priced. I spent around $17 dollars for my order but the amount of fullness I get was unparalleled. Food wise, their fried chicken was american and asian inspired since the breading was different and I would describe to have a texture of chicken karage. The chicken was awesome but I did not like the biscuit at all since they were very bready and dry. I would probably try another sides if I am ever coming back.",

Â To those seeking bathroom breaks during lunch/dinner, you've been warned. Â I ordered the spicy friend chicken sandwich.

Â It was super crispy on the outside, and the hot sauce was the right amount. Â I don't remember the inside being super juicy, but it definitely was not dry.

The food also took a while, but they were a bit busy. However, the staff is incredibly nice and are very happy to help. They just need a bit of time to work some of the kinks out, but I'll still be coming!I ordered the bulgogi chicken tacos, and it was only okay. To be fair, they're more known for fried chicken, but I didn't want anything too heavy. I am curious to try their fried chicken sandwiches! Anyway, back to the tacos. The tortillas were a bit too thick for my liking and the sauce was a bit salty. The other filling was really good! The lettuce was fresh and had a nice crunch to balance the soft tortilla and tender chicken. It's really just the flavor of the sauce and the tortilla that didn't make this taco so good.Right now the rating is how it is when it first opened, but I'm sure it'll get better as they learn with this opening period. I'll come back a couple more times to try their other, more well-known items, but as of right now, this place is only alright.",

The sauces aren't my absolute favorite, but they get the job done. The sandwiches are good too - occasionally they overdo the amount of sauce on the sandwich, so it ends up being too salty, but it's usually not a problem. The only thing is that they do have a tendency to get backed up with orders, so expect to wait for your order if you don't order ahead of time. For the most part - the people their are also very nice and helpful, there have only been a couple of workers there that may be a bit standoffish but not rude or anything.

    "review": "My friends and I ended up coming here after seeing that a new place opened on the Ave, and it had pretty good reviews on Yelp. For our party of 4, we were seated pretty quickly for a Saturday night at 7PM. The service was a bit on the slow side, but there was another group of about 20 students in the restaurant, so the servers may have had their hands full.We ordered the seafood hot pot, the pork hot pot, and some steamed pork belly dish. For like $13, the pork belly came in a tiny pot, and there were maybe only about 6 pieces in total. It was really good, the flavor was rich and tasted authentic. However its tiny size made it not really worth the price. The hot pot, on the other hand, was really good. The soup was savory and warm, and there was even an egg in there that slowly cooked as the pot boiled. I also like the vegetables in the hot pot- they were able to soak in the soup and ended up getting all the flavor. The pork in the soup was really good- it was pretty tender and juicy. I wish there was a bit more meat in the bot pot tho-- more seafood or more pork. I felt like for a group of 4, there was not a substantial amount of protein, as opposed to the vegetables. However, it was good enough that we did finish both pots though. The only reason that this place only gets 2 stars instead of higher is that the rice that we were served was SPOILED. It smelled and tasted sour, like it's been left sitting somewhere damp for too long. Now I'm going to assume that's probably dangerous in some capacity (like... food poisoning, maybe?) and that's absolutely unacceptable for a restaurant. I realized the flavor and spat it out immediately. Luckily, the servers seemed to notice and quickly served us fresh rice, so that was nice. But for me, it kind of ruined the experience and the meal, as it made me doubt the freshness of all the other food that they had here. I think I'd like to give this place another try someday, but I'll probably explore some of the other Chinese restaurants in the area first.",

The menu has a lot of variety (mini hot pots, rice noodles, steam dishes, etc.) so it took awhile for us to decide what we wanted to order. Service was slower than I would have liked probably because there was another large party there that night. Â  The mini pots (ranging from $14.99-16.99) feed two people so we ordered the Seafood and Tofu as well as the Pork Ribs one for a table of four. We also ordered the House Special Steamed Pork Belly ($12.99). We waited for the food for quite a long time and for some reason the server brought out our rice very early; it ended up getting cold as we waited for our entrees. My friend tried the rice and said it didn't smell or taste very fresh. Luckily the waiter changed our rice again (he must have noticed) and gave us fresh, hot bowls when the food finally came out.The mini pots are delicious and steaming warm. The only difference between the two were the contents; flavor-wise they taste the same. I would have liked the seafood and tofu one to have a bit more substance in it. I think there were maybe 2 or 3 pieces of shrimp and barely any clams...mostly veggies and tofu. The pork belly we ordered was also delicious and juicy. It was served in a small bamboo steamer with preserved mustard greens (that's when you know it's authentic). I wouldn't order this dish again for the price. For $12.99 this dish was almost dim sum sized, very disappointing.I would definitely come back to eat again but I would only order the mini pots. Everything else seems a bit overpriced .",

Reasonable prices, fast service, and perhaps most importantly, lives up to its name with its fantastic food.Atmosphere: We went in around 8:30pm and were only one of two tables seated, so it was pretty quiet, although I could see it getting noisy during peak hours. Super modern and cute. Has a very Instagram-able \"Tasty\" wall.Food: If you're looking for good authentic Chinese food, this is it. Each person gets complimentary soup. We had the garlic pork belly, BBQ pork, and eggplant and ground pork in garlic sauce. The garlic pork belly was my favorite, but I also loved the noodles in the BBQ pork dish.Prices: For an appetizer + two entrees, we paid $33 for two people post-tax/pre-tip. Good quantity and quality for the price. We were thoroughly full afterwards.Service: Fast! Our water was constantly refilled and the food came out relatively quickly. We weren't checked in on very often, but I think that it may have been partially due to the language barrier (the waiters/waitresses seemed mostly fluent in Chinese, and my Chinese sucks).Location: This restaurant took the place of the old \"I See Food\" Cajun restaurant. It's located on the Ave between 43rd and 45th, very close to UW campus. Beware of limited street parking!Final thoughts: It wouldn't surprise me in the least to see this place become a hit with UW students and locals alike. Highly recommended!",

    "review": "Disclaimer: I've never actually been here in person, so I can't speak for the in-person service. This review is based purely off food quality. I recently ordered a chirashi bowl from Big Tuna off Uber Eats. The quantity was superb considering the price (around $14, not including delivery fee). It came with a few varieties of fish, miso soup, seaweed salad, and a generous serving of seasoned rice. While the rice and soup were delicious, I found the flavor of each fish to be lacking. The salmon and tuna, which are my favorite types of fish, both tasted considerably bland. The other fish weren't much better. Maybe it's because I've become too spoiled by other sashimi joints nearby like Musashi's, but I was fairly let down.This place has 3.5 stars on Yelp, which I think is a pretty accurate rating. After this experience, I can say that it's certainly not my favorite place for sashimi, but if I were looking for a quick bite to eat with no wait, I'd likely consider it as an option.",

My boyfriend got the regular teriyaki and said it lacked flavour and he liked mine better, but he still liked it! I enjoyed the salad dressing as well. Maybe could use more spices in everything to jazz it up but it was definitely not bad! The lady at the counter was really nice and it looked clean inside. Definitely worth a try if you'd like both sushi and teriyaki. It may be my new hangover cure spot. Plus there are a few parking spots to make it easier to deal with being in University District. It's cheap, quick enough and filling.",

The waiter service was average, nothing great or bad. I ordered the California burrito both times by coincidence and enjoyed them both: extremely flavorful with the right ratio between meat and veggies. I was also surprised by the generous amount of avocado in the burrito, since typically restaurants put a tiny piece of avocado in a dish and call it \"California.\"The value isn't amazing by any means, and I wouldn't call it a \"steal\" of the Ave, being around $15 with tax and tip for a generous, but not gigantic portion. I usually prefer to pay less than $10 for a meal at a restaurant, but I guess that's the small extra price to pay for sit-down service. I'll be back, but it won't become a regular go-to.",

I was in such a mood when I stopped here for brunch on a Sunday.I was greeted pretty quickly and shown to a sunny table. (A treat in Seattle in October.) I liked the warm decor of the restaurant. They didn't have many options for brunch drinks, only mimosas if I recall. The mimosa was tasty. It's hard to go wrong with them but plenty a restaurant has, so credit where it's due. I ordered a special, the bread pudding french toast. It came in two large slices drizzled in berry compote and served with whipped cream and ice cream. I understand the urge to serve bread pudding with ice cream if it's a dessert, but it was unnecessary with breakfast. The whipped cream did the trick just fine. The texture was dense and it was a plentiful meal, but I was disappointed in the execution. If you're combining the heavenly blessings of bread pudding and french toast, the result shouldn't be inferior to both. It did the trick in terms of filling me up for a Sunday nap. If I returned I'd try the standard fare - not all specials work out as planned.",

I also was reading the reviews of this place as I sat down...so that really put me off. First off, this place was not busy and there was one waiter, It took almost 5 mins for the waiter to acknowledge and seat me. It took over 15 mins to take my order, and it took almost 25 mins for the food to come out. If it were really busy and a complicated dish...I wouldn't have cared or minded. I had ordered Greek Spaghetti. Very simple dish. Everyone who walked in after me was checked on by the waiter and got their food before I did. This really bothered me. I didn't get silverware or a refill of water, and was very angry with the lack of care or service I received. Besides the poor service, the food was average at best. The noodles were fettichini noodles and not spaghetti. The chicken was the best part of the dish. It was cooked and presented very nice over the bed of spaghetti. Honestly, I could make the dish for under $15 and better with ingredients from Trader Joe's. It is seriously restaurants like Costas, their indifference to their customers, and their expensive prices that inspire me to cook my own meals at home. People come to your restaurant for a good experience and good food. I received neither and won't be coming back. I will take my money and business elsewhere.",

The scrambles, omelettes and skillets are fantastic and filling, while the waffle with strawberries and whipped cream made me smile ear to ear from happiness.

He's like, \"Uh...I think so,\" and starts looking through his wallet while the waitress just continues staring, and I'm thinking - doesn't this place take cards?

The location on the Ave isn't much to look at, but the restaurant is quite large, decorated with a lot of kitschy stuff/ Iranian photos, and service is friendly. Parking in the area is kind of a pain, so plan accordingly.I find Persian food to be quite expensive in general, but Persepolis was very reasonable, given the portion size. The only issue we had was for a side order of tahdig with ghormeh sabzi. $13 for a plate of crispy rice and a bit of stew was crazy steep. The tahdig was on the fresher side, but the ghormeh sabzi lacked flavor and salt. It definitely could've used more of that delicious Persian lime.Boyfriend and I shared the mast-o-moosir and the king's choice combination platter, with one koobideh, one joojeh, and one barg. This was plenty of food for two, and arrived with a plate of rice and grilled tomato. Everything needed a sprinkle of salt and sumac, but the meat was tender and pretty flavorful. We finished our meal with the akbar mashti, which was SO good. Overall, solid Persian food in a casual atmosphere.",

Exited from I-5 South sooner than intended. Eventually found street parking along the sketchier portion of the upper Ave. Time to revisit some Persian cuisine.Entered Persepolis Grill and that ahhhh feeling soon envelopes you. Warmly greeted, handed menus, and provided water. The restaurant is much larger than initial glance. The dining area extends further back to another section. Lots of photographs adorn the walls. Lively Gypsy Kings music played. I kept staring at the nice floor, clean and well maintained. I have no idea why I was fixated on that, after our orders were placed.I was told the restaurant had gone through two ownerships but has been in existence for about 17 years, after I had inquired. I wished I ordered some lavash, as my stomach grumbled.The restaurant started filling up with various sized groups, two, four, seven, etc. Even takeout. This must keep the kitchen hopping.No starters, just focused on entrees. And the as our platters arrives, the entrees selected were monstrous! Easily shareable or for ample leftovers to box up to take home.Another family member selected the Bakhtiari Kabob (1 each beef tenderloin and chicken) with Saffron Rice ($25). He ate half, rest was later devoured by The Homie at home. For dessert, he enjoyed the Sholeh Zard, similar to a rice pudding ($5).Me - go big or go home! I went for the King's Platter ($30). There's a pair of roasted plum tomatoes and one each of the grilled minced beef, tenderloin beef, and chicken plus a huge platter of saffron rice. A nice touch was the shaker full of sumac to add to the grilled meats. Easily could have served 2-3 people, and yes, most of it got packaged up to take home.I needed to save precious room to try the Persian Ice Cream ($6). It was worth it, and yes, I polished it off! Generously served with a beautiful saffron hue, one could taste the rose water, pomegranate syrup, almonds, and pistachios. Mmmmmm!Next visit...definitely I will focus on the minced beef again but will add the lamb chops. Great find and welcoming culinary haven!",

Â Add in the fact that they're actually open after 9 PM on weekdays unlike any other food place in this town and my heart is won.I ordered delivery despite the myriad reviews warning me not to -- luckily my food arrived right at the tail end of the quoted delivery window, still warm and definitely fresh. Â There's a $25 delivery minimum which is kind of a pain, but two curries and an appetizer got me there easily (and will be enough for at least two more meals, that's lunch sorted for the rest of the week). Â Everything was tasty, but the baingan bharta is absolutely divine. Â Creamy, silky eggplant decadently spiced with perfectly cooked basmati rice...I sort of wish I'd gotten two orders of that alone, but the mushroom matar (kind of a hard dish to find vegan!) was also tasty, albeit a little more tomato-y and less creamy than I'd have liked. Â Veggie pakoras were pretty standard, but I appreciated the tamarind and mint chutneys included in the cost. Â The food here is definitely spiced to American standards, i.e. weak sauce, so order 'hot' if you too love for your eyes to water when you eat.I would love to come here sometime and try the lunch buffet!

The sauce was good, I combined them together because it had a better balance. The only critique I had about the naan was that I couldn't taste the spiced onion at all.

Coming in, you can browse the menu, order, and grab water at the counter. This is what we had:*PupusaPupusa is a thick corn tortilla that can be stuffed with different fillings. You can choose up to 3 fillings at no extra charge. We ordered 3 pupusa with different fillings in each. 1: nopal (cactus), ayote (zucchini), and spinach2: chicken, cheese, and jalapeno3: pork and cheesePupusa #1 and #2 were extremely bland as Â if they weren't seasoned at all. Fortunately the curtido (fermented cabbage relish) was there to make them more palatable. Pupusa #3 was the most fragrant and flavorful. If you're getting the pupusa, I'd recommend sticking with the pork filling.*Pastelitos GuanacosThis fried corn flour pocket resembles empanadas a lot. The beef and potato filling were savory and but could've used more seasonings to enhance the flavor.*BuÃ±uelos en mielWoah! Where have you been all my life!? The earthy flavor coming from the yuca dough was gratifying. The piloncillo syrup added gentle sweetness to the dough. I could munch on them all day! Highly recommended!Overall, we were only impressed by the buÃ±uelos en miel. I think they really need to play and work around with the seasonings. Until then, I'm still on another hunt for top-notch Salvadoran delicacies!",

Then a homeless man opened the door, and most humbly and pathetically said he was freezing cold and hadn't slept all night and could he please, please, please have a hot cup of coffee. The cook/owner led him to a seat and brought him coffee as though he was a prince, and soon after brought him a little meal. Now the homeless gent felt pretty important and put his feet up on the chair opposite his little table, and asked, \"You wouldn't have a newspaper would you?\" And the cook ran across the street to a newspaper box and bought the guy a newspaper.He must not have done that often or the place would be full of hobos.

I discovered it this week and have gone there three times already. -the bread is a little thinner and denser than other gyro places' pita but I prefer it this way. It has a better texture and it's easier to eat since it's more firmly wrapped around. -I've tried shish kabob lamb, chopped chicken breast, and the traditional gryo-meat lamb. The meat is tender and salty and yummy. The shish kabob lamb was especially good; not tough or dry, but soft and juicy. They fry the lamb and chicken meat on a grill to order -there is a wonderful taste of garlic... I'm not sure if it's in the creamy sauce on top or fried with the meat, but it's amazing-they add enough tomato and iceberg lettuce choppings to give a nice cool, moist texture to the sandwich -the prices are slightly lower $6-7 than what I expected-the guy is really nice too",

Solid sandwich selection, and extremely friendly service. Only complaint is that they didn't toast my bread, nor did they ask me if I wanted it toasted. I guess I just assume that it's OBVIOUS that EVERYONE wants a toasted sandwich, but maybe not. Heard a guy later ask for his toasted, and it didn't seem like a problem, so just remember to ask!Only a small counter for seating; probably designed to mostly do to-go orders.

Â For lunch Chili's South Indian Restaurant offers a buffet, which seemed great for us since we love trying various different items. Â But it fell short. We visited on a Thursday and the place was packed. Â There was a long line for takeout, in addition to a group of people waiting to get buffet items in the small space. Â It gets busy here. Â But for the two of us we were able to be seated.The buffet was small, probably the smallest Indian buffet I've seen. Â I was also surprised by how few south Indian dishes there were, since the name of this place suggests otherwise. Â The buffet had a lot of the classic northern Indian items you'd find at many other spots, like butter chicken and paneer. Â The items were a mix of vegetarian and meat options. Â Naan was freshly made and was delivered to our table. Of the items I liked the shredded beet roots and chicken kersala the best. Â The chicken kersala had a nice spice to it, which I enjoyed. Â And the shredded beet roots were something I've never had before, but if you love beets, it's a good side to get. Â Lemon rice was quite nice, with a tart flavor. Â Everything else was fine. Â The most disappointing part was the fact that they didn't make more tandoori chicken, even though we came an hour before closing. Chili's wouldn't be my first place to get Indian food, but the location on the Ave is convenient. Â You'll definitely get your fill with the lunch buffet, but the selection is limited and few. Â Service was also on the slower side.",

The fish is much more tender and and tastes fresher. They have a better selection of fish, with some that are just seasoned or seared, not drenched in sauce like every choice at Hiroshi's.

Just PokÃ© just opened up a couple of months ago on The Ave. It is a chain with multiple locations throughout Washington, but I had only been to the Issaquah location prior to this.Just PokÃ© offers Signature Bowls as well as Build Your Own Bowls. I always go with the Build Your Own Bowl option. They also have two sizes: regular (two proteins) and large (three proteins). A regular is usually enough for me, but I also like to load up on toppings and mix-ins.Today, I ordered a regular bowl with half medicine (brown) rice, half salad, salmon (unfortunately they were out of spicy salmon by noon) and creamy scallops. I got all of the mix-ins, except for jalapeÃ±os, and had them tossed in a mix of dynamite (sriracha and eel sauce) and creamy sesame sauces. The sauce combo ended up being a little too sweet for my taste, so I would not recommend getting the eel and sesame sauces together. Like I mentioned, I load up on toppings, so I again got everything except for avocado which was an additional dollar. I also asked for double mango cause it's sunny and also Tropical Tuesday. It's also the only pokÃ© place I've been to that offers pineapple and mango as topping options.My total ended up being about $13 including tip, which is the going-rate for pokÃ© bowls in Seattle. I have to agree with my fellow Yelpers that the protein scoop portions are definitely on the smaller side compared to Hiroshis or FOB. I honestly think the Just PokÃ© in Issaquah is more generous with their portions, but oh well. However, they are very generous with the amount of toppings and mix-ins. Service was excellent.Overall, this place lives up to its name and really is \"just pokÃ©\". I grew up eating pokÃ© in Hawaii, and while this place is good and convenient for UW students, there are better pokÃ© places in Seattle.5/5 stars for service, 3.75/5 stars for food",

They were efficient at preparing the poke bowls but I was upset that the rice came out hot so they had to layer the bottom of the bowl with mixed greens. I was also disappointed at the portion size of the fish. The lady serving it did not fill the spoon completely so I felt like I was a bit cheated of my value. I only got like 5-6 pieces of fish. I hope they will be more generous with the portion sizes moving forward. Other than those issues, the fish was very fresh as they pride in their fish being high quality. I'm very pleased with the choice of fish. They had raw and cooked options. There was a lot of sauces to choose from and I could mix and match.

Anyway the food was very very bland for poke and there was like no flavor or seasoning unfortunately, even with sauce and all the toppings. The only upside is that their fish pieces are huge but I had to get two scoops because one scoop was way too little. Since it was bogo, it was ~$7 for each bowl, but without the deal would be $12+ for one bowl. The portion is kinda small compared to other poke locations and my plastic bowl got distorted from the hot rice. I give it 3 stars because I like fish and we got our order first.

    "review": "If it were possible, I'd give this a 3.5.My spicy tuna bowl was ok. The protein portion sizes seemed a bit smaller than other poke places I've visited, but I got the large bowl and still felt full. The ingredients themselves all looked and tasted... average. Nothing seemed problematically old or wilted, but it didn't taste thrillingly fresh either. It was definitely quite spicy. They do offer free water, which I appreciated... but much like many other restaurants who offer free water, the only cups provided are tiny cups. I was dining with a friend and spent most of my meal getting up every few minutes to walk over to the water jug and back again. The free water has ice and infused fruit, which I appreciate. Unfortunately it was infused with grapefruit which I strongly dislike.Pricing also seemed average, but I've been spoiled by paying the same prices for fresher ingredients at other competitors. In general, if it was truly necessary, I'd rather pay $1-2 more per bowl to get fresher ingredients.The packaging all seemed compostable, but when I went to throw it away, there were three open bins with no labelling for garbage/compost/recycling, and they all seemed to be mixed together. So I didn't get the impression that they were composting or even recycling. I dislike that on a personal level, but I also thought that city law required separation from restaurants.On the positive side, my server was friendly and helpful. The restaurant and bathrooms were significantly cleaner than many other restaurants on the Ave. I also liked the soundtrack (SG Lewis & Clairo's Runaway is one song I remember, it was mostly pop + poppy electronic.)",

Fair price for poke in Seattle but much better product available at places like FOB.While I appreciate their efforts to be fully compostable, the fish was mixed in a paper tray before serving.

I've eaten here at least once a week for 3 years and always feel fantastic afterwards.* The sandwiches are good, but not the specialty. For the money, it's a great value, but the reason I give this place five stars are the details of the other dishes. For example, Samir's salads, tahini, baba ghanoush, vegan yogurt, hot sauces, etc. with vegetables and felafel (and a meat if you like) combine to make one of the healthiest, and delicious meals on the ave. For the money, it's probably the highest ratio of vegetables, healthy fats and proteins versus empty carbs on the ave. This place kept me alive through grad school. Each time I order 'the same dish', Samir makes it slightly different. The food is always great, and I'm never bored by it. * Samir and his family are great - It's always fun to visit and chat as the meal is prepared. Service is the best. The atmosphere is very casual, but in a comfortable way. * While I still believe his felafel is the best I've had in Washington, it's still a tricky beast. Felafel can be hit and miss because of the cooking time and sitting time. I've never had a bad felafel here, but I've had some that were just ok, and many great. Be patient and give it another shot if your first felafel was 'good', but not great.",

This is great for me because I don't carry cash usually.4. It's inexpensive. I think each dish was $8.95 compared to Thai Tom's $12.

They were friendly and welcoming with each new table-addition that was brought. They were quick to take our orders. What I was most surprised about was that they accurately wrote down and delivered food to each individual in our party of 20. I think there may have been one mistake, but even then. It was an amazing feat since they were also keeping track of phone, walk-ins, and other tables. The food was alright.

My friend tried shrimp curry Â and it was delicious for her so all and all I always had a good experience.Plus this place is extremely close to university area and is open a little late which is really nice for students who like to eat in late hours.I would love to go back and eat here. I will also recommend this place for someone looking for spicy noodles of any kind. Definitely worth trying.",

Came in late one night for dinner with a friend, we got the garlic fried rice and the green curry and both were amazing. You can customize your spice level! Food is very simple, so if you're down for just a chill night- this is the place to go :)!There was only one person serving the night we were there, so service may be slow if you come later in the evening.. and she did forget about our calamari.

Since each dish is under $10 it's not a scary endeavor to experiment. I tried the guay jub, hell fire basil noodle, and spicy eggplant (rice dish) and surprise surprise, the non noodle dishes were really sub par, why else would this place be called noodle nation?!The guay jub could very well be my favorite noodle soup dish under $10 in Seattle. The broth is super flavorful, the noodles are uniquely rolled up, and it came with 3 types of meat AND an egg! The hell fire basil noodle had a great subtle basil flavor that was very well balanced, and paired with amazing wok fried noodles with that burnt oily taste (sounds gross but it's actually an amazing flavor profile that's hard to achieve without a wok)The spicy egg plant was a rice dish with surprisingly very little eggplant. Nothing impressive here, but I was very disappointed by this in comparison to the previous two.Overall, this spot has tremendous value for the cost and I'd definitely come back to try the rest of the noodle dishes.",

She was patient, kind, and overall made us feel very welcomed, despite being close to their closing time. The food came out quickly, as others have mentioned I wouldn't say that the taste of the food is especially novel or savory but my shrimp Guay Tiew Kua was enjoyable and I appreciated the size of the portion compared to the price.

The Fresh rolls were large...lacked a bit in the tofu department as it was mostly lettuce but they were OK. Yummy peanut sauce to accompany it. I always get a little sticker shock on fresh rolls as $7-$8 seems high for food that is mostly some cheap veggies but whatevs. All in all I would recommend for a quick bite.

    "review": "People really be sleeping on Noodle Nation.Location:located on the Ave, the go-to place it you're looking for places to eat. Noddle Nation is very close to the UW so you don't have to waste time walking/busing to the place in order to satisfy your Phad Thai cravings. Atmosphere:Noodle Nation kinda of has a retro feeling to it. When you walk in, you are greeted with walls filled with decor. From street signs to posters to pictures of their food. They even have Christmas lights hanging on the ceiling. People may feel it's cluttered, but I think it feel very homey and personalized. It feels as if I am getting to know the owners despite not talking to them. I think their decor really sets them apart from all the other Thai places on the Ave. What Did I Try?Phad Thai with tofu is my go to! The Phad Thai is sweet and tangy so getting a higher spiciness level balances out the sweetness. The noodle are cooked so that there is still some bite in them, making them chewy. The dish also comes with a side of chopped peanuts, carrots, and bean sprouts. The fresh sprouts and carrots, when eaten alone, add a nice freshness to the heavy dish as well as a crunch. The tofu here is one of the best tofus I have tried at a Thai restaurant. It's light and airy, almost like a sponge. I have tried their Drunken Noodles and I have to say I am not a fan. Compared to other Thai places, I find their Drunken Noodles to lack flavor and vegetables. To me, it feels as if I paid money for some plain, oily noodles with like 5 pieces of vegetables. Price:Both their Phad Thai and Drunken Noodles are $9.95 making it a cheap but very delicious option, especially if you're on a college budget like I am.Service:The employees are really nice, and attentive! I was really hungry so every time someone would come out with a plate of food, I would look back and see if it was mine. The lady noticed and updated me on my order. It made me feel like that actually care about their customers. When they gave my friend and I water, it was lukewarm. I wish it had been cold. In addition, I noticed the plates, and the bottom of their cups that they served on had black residues which was kind of concerning. However, their Phad Thai is still really good!Notes:- they close around a certain time and open again at 5PMOverall:I was going to give this place 4 stars because their Phad Thai is so good, but the dirty looking dishes made me give them 3 stars",

Both medium spice level.Food came out a little bit on the slower side but it was busy so I'll let it pass. For its price, it was definitely delicious and didn't taste americanized. The portions were a good size, I was full with mine and didn't get to finish all of the curry because they give so much.

As for the noodles, we barely had any! It was mostly broth! This place really skimps on the meat and noodles which was extremely disappointing considering that the food overall flavor of the food was good. Check my photos and tell me if you can spot any meat or noodles lol.The service here does the bare minimum. It started with my server giving me an eye roll and slight attitude when I asked her a clarifying question about the menu. I found that to be a bit rude. Our server basically brought us our food and that was it. Never checked in and refilled waters or anything and had to get up to ask for the check to pay.Ultimately, the food was not that bad, but the service and bad attitude really killed it for me.

That being said, I will have to brave the crazy Farmers Market parking on Saturdays in the future to have this rare delicacy. This time I ordered the mac 'n cheese empanada and one other savory vegetarian option. The guy working the booth was making them fresh on the spot and let me know they'd be ready in a few minutes. I walked around to the other booths and then came back and picked up my lunch bites. Prices are a little steep at $4 each, but it's the only place I've found in Seattle that makes them how I like them! I will be back to try the other options for sure!",

Piping hot, melty ricotta and melty guava in a buttery flaky shell. They have a menu that includes a list of savory empanadas and sweet empanadas. They also offer empty pre-baked empanada shells if you want to stuff them with your favorite fillings. You can order any number of flavors ahead of time and pick them up at the Farmers Market booth.

Before they offered pick-up in Lake City, I met the daughter a couple of times at the downtown Costco with a cheque in hand to receive my yummy treats!My absolute favourite is their beef empanada - a savoury mix of minced beef with onions, sweet peppers, raisins, hard-boiled egg + spices. A couple of those appetizer-sized baked in the oven paired with some fresh fruit or a salad and you have the perfect meal!The other varieties I've had were also quite solid, namely the chicken with peppers, onions, mushrooms + Swiss, and their spinach with mushrooms, onions, boiled egg and Swiss! What can I say... I'm a sucker for Swiss cheese. I'd like to try their sweet varieties especially the apple with dulce de leche. It sounds heavenly and I imagine having it warm from the oven with a little scoop of frozen yoghurt.What else can I tell you about them? Pricing might be high at first glance but they are homemade and definitely made with love. The ingredients are also high quality and I was never disappointed from my first one to the last of the batch. They arrive frozen and will keep nicely for future use. I liked having the savoury ones on hand for those nights when I didn't feel like cooking an entire meal.Oh yeah! You can mix and match the varieties within a dozen so if you wanted to try half savouries with half sweet, they will accommodate you. All of the email communication that I ever had with them has been speedy and friendly. I cannot recommend them enough and if I could give another star, I would!",

Saigon Deli has been one of my favorite Vietnamese restaurants that I have consistently come back to for the past three years. The manager is always very friendly and if you order a banh mi to go, she makes sure you get it in less than five minutes! I often grab a banh mi for when I'm on the go in between classes!Get: The Banh Mi- I recommend the pork, but the tofu is good too! I find the chicken to salty for my taste. They put cilantro, jalapeÃ±os, and pickled carrots inside of a buttered and toasted baguette! The BÃºn- I like the tofu, shrimp and egg roll bÃºn. It comes with lots of veggies, noodles, and protein! The sauce is also very flavorful. I recommend getting it spicy if you like a little kick!The Vietnamese Coffee (but only in the early morning)- I ordered a Vietnamese coffee (coffee with condensed milk) at this place with my dinner one time, and was up until 5am the next morning! I drink coffee on a daily basis and usually have no problem, but this stuff is extremely strong! Perfect for college students pulling an all nighter!Skip: The Chow fun. I was very disappointed that they used vermicelli instead of traditional wide chow fun noodles. It should really be called just stir fried vermicelli with vegetables. Tip: If you eat at the restaurant, you get a free house-made yogurt for dessert! It's the perfect amount of sweetness and tartness.",

The meat in it was ok and overall flavor was lacking, but I could see that being a family cooked dish if I was Vietnamese. It also came with a free yogurt dessert which was pretty good and similar to a Beijing yogurt, which can be really expensive here in the US (3 bucks for a small cup at the Asian Mart up on the ave).

All the barstools can't be moved and all the booths are raised--plus, even so, there is no space to pull up next to a booth even if you had an adjustable wheelchair.When we asked where we could sit, the employees offered that we could pull up at the end of the cashier's counter, which was a super awkward spot and both of us (one wheelchair and one non-wheelchair) couldn't really fit well. We decided to not order and go get food elsewhere. The employees weren't mean, they just hadn't been trained on what to do in this situation; obviously the owners had no knowledge about accessible practices or what is required by the ADA.Their food looked good and we contemplated ordering it to go, but we didn't really want to support a business that remodeled their inside to make it significantly less accessible.

We wanted to switch it up, and since this place is open until 2am we figured we'd give it a try.First off, I want to say I went back and forth between 3 & 4 stars with this place. However, I did end up bumping it up to 4 stars for a few reasons.1. The staff was super friendly. Even though it was after 12am, the guy behind the counter seemed happy to help us and explained to us how the Ric and Morty pizza got its name (because it has RICotta cheese and MORTadella on it- I thought that was funny!)2. I did think the pizza was nothing extraordinary. Not bad at all, but not the best I've ever had. However, I do partially account that to the fact that we came in super late, so they just ran a couple slices that had been sitting in the window through a little warmer for 5 minutes and served them. I think I think if I came back earlier when the pizza is a little fresher I would think it was a little better. On the plus side, they use my FAVORITE kind of pepperonis, and the ranch they had for dipping was really tasty too. My 2 friends both got the Ric and Morty pizza and said it was really good. I also got the garlic knots, which were a little fresher and had a really good flavor. However, the cheese sauce they were served with was not my favorite. It honestly smelled so bad I got up and threw it away. Maybe that's just personal preference, but I couldn't stand the flavor of it.The reason I am taking off a star is because I was with some friends who were under 21, and the area for under 21 year olds is really small and not that well set up. They had one little bar with ~6-8 seats, and the stools they had were awkwardly spaced from each other and were mounted into the ground, so my friends and I were just sitting an awkward distance away from each other. The stools really irked all of us.I just think that being so close to the UW campus, and having replaced Pagliaccis (which was super inviting to people of all ages), Supreme could have done a better job setting up an area for younger college students. However, the security guy who was monitoring the 21+ section from minors was actually pretty friendly (not like a lot of places where those guys are super rude to younger people), so that was at least nice. The rest of the staff was really nice too, so it kind of made up for the fact that it kind of felt like we were just shoved in a corner. Overall, I'm giving this place a 4 star instead of 3 because I still know I would like to go back, and because everyone working there still made us feel welcomed even though we weren't old enough for the bar.",

Supreme replaced a paggliaccis pizza place that used to be here before and I was always curious to try it. When we went in, there was a huge areas designated for people who were over 21. My friends and I are not over 21 yet so we could not sit in the main area. One thing that was disappointing was that the area for people under 21 consisted only of about 4-6 stools that were against a small countertop across a wall. I found this disappointing because paggliacci was such a friendly inviting place for people of all ages to be and considering it is on the ave, only a few short blocks away from the UW college campus, it would be nice for Supreme to be more inviting to all ages. Regarding the pizza, I had one slice of the Ric and Morty and my friend got the Double pepperoni Â and garlic knots. The Ric and Morty was a little bland, I felt like it was missing something. But it also was somewhat minimal and had no sauce which I knew when I ordered it. The crust was so good, probably one of the best pizza crusts I have ever had. The garlic knots were definitely exploding in flavor, however they were a little dry and I wish they came with a sauce other than marinara. Overall, I will probably not be going back there until I am 21, but I would still recommend it for people who are over 21 as the vibe seemed fun and I did enjoy the pizza.",

Â I grabbed a menu and asked about the salads and he said he has salads and looked at the person behind me and took their order.

    "review": "Checked this place out after they got their liquor license, and are therefore open past 4pm. I'd bussed by many times, but they were never open - their neon sign caught my attention though. Right as you walk in, you're greeted by all of the slice options behind glass, near the warming oven. It's similar to how Big Marios on Capitol Hill feels in that sense - both in format, and in selection. Inside, it's an interesting mix of bar area and tucked away booths. They don't have too much space, but they make it work without it feeling too crowded. Overall my impressions were: Atmosphere: Pretty good, it fits in well with the Ave. It feels a little \"modern\"/sterile right now, when it's clear the atmosphere they're going for is more grungey. I think it just needs a few months of usage and that will be sorted out. The other thing I noticed was the music (while the selection was good) was very boomy. A bit too much bass which made it feel accidentally like a club. Food: Pretty good. Got garlic knocks and a slice of basil double-cheese. Both were good, but I was surprised by the tab: the garlic knots were on the pricier slide, while the slice was more reasonable. Service: Excellent, staff were friendly and seemed happy. The bartender was talking with customers and it had a good neighborhood feel. Recommended, and it's a welcome addition to the neighborhood and especially so, considering that it's replacing Pagliacci.",

I'm not going to write this review to critically evaluate the authenticity, or overall quality of Aladdins compared to other Middle Eastern/ Mediterranean places, because I do not feel qualified to do that. All I can tell you is that this place checks the box for value, availability (open late late night) consistency, and debatably most important to me, customer service. Any Aladdin regular will be familiar with the \"Aladdin fry\" which is one of my favorite items at any establishment I have ever been. Its basically all the best parts of a gyro dumped on top of fresh hot fries. If asked how I could improve this item, I honestly have no suggestion or response because I dare say it's perfect. I have not tried a whole lot else from here, but the quality of their meat, etc and their attention to detail when assembling things (ie frys gyros etc) would lead me to believe their other items are of a similar quality. The most important part of my review is this. The entire staff are the most welcoming, and fun loving guys I have experienced as a customer. Jamal, and Khaled remember me by name, and always make my visit special. All the other members of the staff carry themselves joyfully and make hospitality a goal. I came here on my 21st birthday, and Jamal made sure to make my time there special, and even gave me a free dessert. I could go on, but in short these guys are people you want be friends with.Thank you Aladdin for helping me make amazing memories consistently each time. I will be a lifetime patron. God bless. See you in the next week probably.",

In the Aladdin gyro, they give you a hunk of sizzling meat. The veggies inside are so fresh and crisp, and the pita is warm and molds the filling. It's so flavorful because of the sauce and has all the right juices flowing down your mouth and hands. Make sure to grab a bunch of napkins. The Aladdin fries tho.. Every bite is perfection. The saltiness of the fries go well with the cheesiness of the feta and the lamb/beef just top it all off. The different textures from how soft the cheese is to the crispy skin of the fries just balance out so well. Perfect to share for two people.

The bar-like ambiance definitely fits in with the college lifestyle of the area with its low lighting, black lights, and late business hours. We came specifically to try the patbingsoo and had the following flavors, in order of my personal preference - green tea, milk and mango. The green tea patbingsoo had just the right amount of green tea taste without being overbearing, while the texture of the ice was light and soft. The mango came in last because even with the fruit, I felt that the mango taste of the ice was almost too subtle. Dessert is a little on the pricier side with the classic milk patbingsoo starting at $11 and flavored patbingsoo, like the mango and green tea, starting at $13. It's important to note that toppings are not included, and things like red bean and mochi are extra. For now, even condensed milk on the side is a $1 more, but it sounded like the dessert menu could possibly change in the future. I think The Block has a lot of potential once it finalizes its menu and prices, and I can see myself coming back for more patbingsoo in the future.",

I was pretty content with the quantity and quality of my dish, though I did snack a little beforehand which certainly affected my appetite. However, multiple people in my party complained about the small portion sizes. One guy in my group was so hungry after eating his portion that he asked if he could have my leftovers. I guess that should've been the first red flag, but I brushed it off by thinking that maybe those who were complaining were extra hungry (I never actually looked at their bowl to see their portions). There were also complaints that the noodles were overcooked.My second visit is what tipped me over the edge. I ordered the hot stone bibimbap which was very small portion-wise. When I order bibimbap at other nearby restaurants like Yummy Bites or Greenhouse, I almost always have leftovers. Not in this case. My boyfriend and I were both still hungry after finishing our dishes, so right afterwards we ate more food somewhere else. I don't think that should be happening considering the price of the dishes (hot stone bibimbap was probably around ~$13).I might be back to try the patbingsoo, but definitely NOT the food.

It's all you can eat and it's 9 bucks. If that's what matters to you, then go for it! Just note that the female server may pressure you to \"tip here please\", which was a bit off putting. I tipped - and I would have even without the helpful suggestion - but it was just strange to be asked to tip at a buffet. Where you're required to clean your own table.Weird. Just so weird. Maybe I'll come back again if I'm craving mediocre generic Asian food again or if I want to bring people who want to experience weird ambiances with their meals.",

    "review": "Unfortunately this place was a disappointment. I was not inclined to come here because the prices were to expensive and I heard that the food was not that good and very small portions. However, they were having a 50% off deal which inclined me to come here.Strangely enough when I got my food with the 50% off deal my food came out to a regular meal price. I got the soft tofu soup with seafood, the squid pancakes, and oden. It was about $15 which is a regular meal price; however, this is with the 50% off so in actuality like around $30.The soft tofu soup was extremely watery and the clams had sand, you can tell it was done in a rush and the side dishes were very old and smelled strange.The pancakes had so much oil, you can see a puddle of oil if you lifted the pancake off of the plate. In addition you can taste the canola or vegetable oil that they used. Surprisingly it was soggy and doughy on the inside and burnt on the outside which fascinates me on how that was established.The oden taste like your regular oden, fortunately nothing bad there.I do really like the Pat Bing Soo here; however, this is also extremely expensive as well as I paid $7.50 for it (50% off). My girlfriend and I came here a few times for the bingsoo with KSA membership cause we get I think a 20% discount which is when I think it's more worth it's price. The bingsoo I got today the mangos seemed unripe unfortunately as it felt like I was eating apples instead of mangos....I was extremely disappointed in this restaurant. It seems like they should stick to being a bar since it does have that vibe and seems nice, but it does terrible as a restaurant.",

Perfect amount of cheese and flavoring was pretty good. It wasn't really spicy though, so if you like more spice than ask for extra spice! The hot stone bibimbap was very good as well!! Thoroughly impressed. Came with miso soup too. And lastly the fried chicken was super hot, fresh, and crispy. Only thing is, it didn't come with any sauce:( On top of good food the service was great! Definitely will be coming here again. Also the prices aren't that bad, especially for college students. More affordable than other korean places (in my experience).",

I noticed the owner and he gave me a partial refund on this chicken; the menu I ordered costs 6.99 without tax and he gave me 6.15 in cash. More importantly, his excuses were not understandable to me. He talked in an off-hand manner that I won't get sick for this small portion of raw chicken and this happened because I ordered when the kitchen was about to close. Later he said if I get sick they have insurance to cover my medical bill. I didn't even ask him that. I noticed that this moral hazard does not only threaten the insurance provider but also the health of customers. He did not directly apologize to me and my friend who I came with, and he seemed he doesn't feel sorry about what happened. I felt they only care about the money they get from the customers even if they harm customers' health. If you check out more one-star reviews, you can easily find more evidence that I am not the only one who had raw chicken.",

We walked in and the place was almost empty. We went up to look at the options and flavors when suddenly the worker came up and told us we could not order any dessert.... He said that they usually have two staff members so one can make dessert while the other does the food or something like that... but that was a bit confusing considering there was not a line of people and the dessert is just as expensive as some of the meals... we walked out disappointed... They lost 4 customers for no reason that night... I'm still a bit confused over the whole situation. Why offer dessert if your employees are unable or unwilling to make it?

There were bits of garlic on the wings, but you couldn't taste it all that much most bites. Unless you picked up fallen garlic pieces and stuck it back on the wing. We got an order of the pad see ew, which was really tasty and flavorful. It did come with spice so our daughter couldn't eat it (more for us mwuahaha). I was trying to eat it fast so I could have more than my husband LOL. Lastly, we got the yellow curry with a little bit spice and it was pretty good. Over brown rice - yum. Service was great, everyone was welcoming and friendly. There was a bit of wait for the food, likely exacerbated by my hunger? The space was very cute. And the decor was soothing.

They don't skimp on the filling and they get the wonton so perfectly crispy.

The tom yum was kinda on the watery side lacking some flavor, but still decent. The tofu tempura was amazeballs. I could eat that on it's own but the sauce took it to a whole nother level. Lastly, the fried veggie rolls were just okay. They had a unique taste, almost like they had meat but were still just blah--- I still can't tell if I liked them or not but leaning towards the not. Make sure you remember to order a side of rice if you want it with your curry. I thought it came with it, so we had to scramble last minute to buy some cooked rice. But that was my bad. I actually like that they don't automatically include it, so the curry comes out a tad cheaper.",

We ordered their Monday lunch combo ($11.95) that comes with red curry, one crab rangoon, rice and your choice of entree. I chose their pad thai with tofu.My sister had raved about their pad thai being so delicious so I thought that would be the obvious choice. My sister and mother's dishes came out about 7 minutes before my dish came out and there was no sort of apology or anything for the delay. The table next to us seemed to have a huge issue with how long their food was taking and I felt really bad for the one guest because after waiting close to 30 min, he was told that they were all out of his protein choice. Why wait that long to tell him?! On to the food... The red curry was abysmal. I would not call it a red curry. At all. It was basically just soup with a red color and an INSANELY sweet soup at that. My pad thai was inedible. Literally the SWEETEST pad thai I've ever eaten in a restaurant, I couldn't believe it. It was cloyingly sweet. It's such a shame because without the extra 5 tablespoons of sugar, I could tell that the pad thai actually had some good flavor!! I left most of my pad thai and all of the red curry, but the server didn't even care to ask whether we enjoyed our meal or not. At $11.95 per person I guess you can't really complain.

My total came out to $9.91 including tax, which is super cheap for teriyaki on the Ave; most teriyaki places charge around $15.The chicken was tasty, but some of the pieces of chicken were extremely burnt and inedible. The teriyaki sauce also lacked flavor and viscosity; it was fairly watery. I also got some spicy sauce on the side, but it was fairly mild and also rather watery. The vegetables and rice were good though. My friend recommended asking to get the sauce over everything, instead of just the meat, which i will ask for next time.Overall, BBs serves average teriyaki for an unbeatable price.

My friend excitedly pointed out that the amount of food you get for your buck here was totally worth it, and let me tell you -- she was 100% right.I think as a student, it's important to find spots that can offer both delicious and affordable food, and I'd say that a SUPER bonus is being able to take home leftovers to suffice you for another meal later on. I was definitely excited to have leftovers for lunch the following day, and was still in awe that this was only for 9$! I ordered the spicy chicken teriyaki with roasted vegetables and mixed green salad. I think what really made me happy is that I could have a healthy meal if I really wanted to, and all for the same price! Additionally, I'd say the customer service also made me really happy, for the cashier was super friendly and attentive. I don't remember her name, but she was a lovely Latina woman & made my visit even more enjoyable.

I ended up ordering white rice with spicy chicken (but regular teriyaki sauce), yakisoba and a green salad. The yakisoba was pretty plain. The noodles were cooked good but there was not much flavor at all. The salad tasted like water. The dressing had no flavor?? The cucumbers in it were very mushy rather than crunchy so a lot of water was sitting on top. The chicken however was really good! It didn't really have strong teriyaki flavors, but it was good.I wouldn't be opposed to coming back here, but it wouldn't be my first choice if I had to get teriyaki on the ave.

I'm in burrito heaven.A friend of mine who's also from CA recommended Memo's as a solid and cheap option for a burrito craving after school. I figure, why not? I wasn't going in with high expectations, I had come to terms with the reality that burritos in Seattle would not match the burritos in Southern California, but oh man... I was taken for a surprise!My friend recommended the \"Washington Burrito,\" which I thought was clever as it seems to be a homage to the common California Burrito - carne asada with french fries. Let me tell you - it was pretty dang tasty and filling! And for 6$?! I'm sold. Not only that, my friend boasted about their salsa bar and I was shook to realize that they WERE in fact authentic - spicy, delicious, and full of flavor.In addition, the restaurant is open 24 hours and located conveniently near the U-District bars... perfect for late night cravings, if you know what I mean ;-)So why the 4 stars? While it was a tasty burrito, and inexpensive... still not 100% comparable to the classic California Burrito. There could've been more flavor and substance to the burrito and the ambiance of the restaurant could be a little more inviting. Nevertheless, I'm excited to find somewhere with burritos that remind me enough of home! :-)",

I was meeting my brother at the airport and was in a rush so I called at around 4am and placed a to-go order so that it'd be ready by the time I showed up. When I got there 15 mins later, the entire restaurant was empty. I didn't see a worker or anyone. I rang the bell around 5 times, and only after 10 minutes did a worker come out from the back. I told him that I was the one that placed the to-go order and it wasn't even ready, nor was it even started to be made. I let it go and figured okay, maybe this guy had to take a shit or something, I get it. Whatever. I can wait an extra 10 minutes it won't kill me. When he rang me up, he overcharged me. Instead of paying for 1 carne asada burrito and 4 soft tacos (2 chicken and 2 carnitas) he accidentally charged me for an extra burrito. Again, I understand, mistakes happen. Easy fix just void it, re-swipe my card for the new total and I'll get the other money back onto my card in a day or two. I let all that slide. When I finally got to the airport to eat with my brother, this guy did not make me a Carne Asada burrito, but instead made me a beef burrito. On top of that, the 2 chicken tacos were HARD tacos, and the carnitas tacos were SOFT tacos. Like how do you get that mixed up?? I understand if all 4 tacos were hard then I could've understood, maybe he misheard me. But making 2 of them soft and 2 hard is a mistake that doesn't happen on accident, you have to REALLY not care to fuck it up that bad. This is about my 5th time coming to Memo's and the service here has always been not so great, but this time it was exceptionally bad.",

The spicy sushi was especially spicy which is exactly the way I like it.

My other friends have come here before, but they all warned me that the people who work here try to rush you out of the restaurant as fast as they can due to limited seating. I agree with them. Service was quick, but they were also prompt to give us our check; this is not the bets place to go to if you want to catch up with friends or have long conversations.Regardless, my friend and I were seated promptly at the sushi bar. It was rather loud because we were seated right next to their speaker system.My friend and I decided to order 4 rolls at 50% off (note that only the rolls are half off, not any of the rest of their menu items): Spicy Tuna Roll, Seahawks Roll, Lion King Roll, and the 52nd Roll.Of the four rolls, the Lion King Roll was definitely the best. It had salmon, imitation crab meat, and spicy mayo. It was also baked and served warm. The rest were okay, but nothing to rave home about. The Seahawks Roll had a generous amount of avocado, but didn't have much taste otherwise. Honestly, most of the rolls served here are basically the same since 90% of them contain artificial crab meat. The fish quality is passable, but definitely on the lower end of sushi grade fish. With tip, our total ended up being around $30, which wasn't extraordinary. However, I think my money could be better spent elsewhere; even conveyor belt sushi had more flavor than some of the rolls here.Overall, this place is overly hyped up. It's sad because there are very few sushi places on The Ave. Price is the only thing that I can think of that draws people in. It's not authentic by any means and you can tell because they serve a mix of Korean foods too.4/5 for service, 3/5 for environment, 2.5/5 for food",

Intrigued, I decided to venture here on a Sunday night with fellow hungry diners.Place is small and seatings are limited so be prepared to wait for a while especially on weekends. We ordered some rolls (husky, snow white, I love crab, volcano scallop, lion king, OMG) and the highly raved grilled pork with kimchi.Rolls were okay, some were better than the others. I like the volcano scallop and OMG rolls while the rest of them weren't that memorable. As other reviews have mentioned, you get what you're paying for. Quality of fish was decent, definitely not comparable to high end sushi joints. They were also heavily doused in sauce, masking the fish flavor.What made things go downhill was the pork belly. They were too thickly cut, overcooked, dry, chewy, tough, and totally bland. All diners in my party voiced similar concern. The kimchi was the only thing that was edible and actually tasted good on that sizzling plate. Not to mention they charged $19 for it, totally not worth it. We didn't finish it. Service was spotty and it was hard to flag down the server since she had to handle multiple tables on her own. Based on my experience, I wouldn't go back here. If you're a college student on a budget, I understand how this place will appeal to you due to its low price and late hours. However, if you're looking for quality sushi / sashimi, this isn't the best choice. I also still couldn't get over that dreadful grilled pork. Wish I had spent that $19 elsewhere.",

We are regulars here and before we ordered everything to go. But once we decided to sit inside. Servers may ignore you. They are very rude. They don't care about you. Once they sit me and my boyfriend by the wall. After 10 minutes they asked to move to another table! Guess why? Because they don't have enough space for another customer! HOW DOES IT POSSIBLE?! Today same situation happened. I was asking to move to table by the wall - they said no.Few times asked about wasabi - they forgot and even didn't say \"sorry\".So, better to order for take out. 1 star for customer service.",

    "review": "I go here A LOT! This is my go-to sushi place in the University District. Spacing is small and seats are limited but the system they have for seating works which is to write your name and how many people are in your group on a clipboard outside. The wait time varies but the most I've ever had to wait was probably ~30 mins. They don't seat your group unless everyone in your party is there. My favorite sushi place to go to in Seattle is Japonessa. Ku's is a great alternative if you live in the UDistrict and don't feel like traveling downtown. Rolls during happy hour are priced around $8 each. A majority of the rolls are really good (I didn't favor the one with JalapeÃ±os) so it's a matter of finding the ones that satisfy your palette. My go-to rolls are the University District and the Sunrise roll. If you like your rolls with a crunch/fried then these are the rolls for you! Generally ordering 2 rolls will leave you feeling satisfied/really full.As for other meals, I've had the takoyaki, cheese corn, and the pork belly. The first 2, not bad, I don't think you'll feel wronged for buying it lol The pork belly on the other hand is pricey ($18) so if you order it yourself with no one to split the cost then you might feel cheated. Taste wise not bad as well!!Anyways, I definitely recommend giving this place a try! Just keep in mind you might have to wait to be seated. Otherwise, service is efficient and you might find that you'll really like their sushi! (:",

Not too strong to be inedible but was noticeable. Hence minus 1 star.2. swimming rama noodles with tofu: This was amazing! The sauce is to die for. The tofu was also nicely soft on the inside.

I wasn't too upset that we got the wrong order, because uber eats refunded us instantly... but the food was so unappetizing I couldn't eat it. I really wanted to like this place because of the cheaper prices, but it is not even worth the low prices!! The pad thai did not taste like any kind of pad thai i've ever had (not in a good way). The noodles were a little undercooked and the pad thai sauce didn't taste like pad thai sauce... I don't think it even tasted a slight bit of authentic thai food. The brown rice was super dry, which I know brown rice tends to be a bit dryer. Even the peanut sauce wasn't good. It was way too thick had a weird texture. Maybe this was just because I ordered delivery but I've never experience that bad of thai food until I ordered from here. But who knows, maybe the other dishes are really good.

The mushrooms did taste very fresh instead of being drenched in sauce like most places, and the Swiss cheese was melted perfectly rather than cold like many places.

I opted to build my own, as ordered by my hunger pains. My burger, which included $1 extra for avocado, an order of regular fries and a drink came out to just around $10. I thought that was a pretty good deal, considering the soda pretty much was 1/3 of the cost. I had a big bottle of water with me, but really... I need to wash the burger down with some fizz. The burger came out with a large portion of fries. This was perfect because my little monster loves fries. This meant mama would have some at least. Overall, I was really pleased with the burger. The patty is a bit thin, but it's nice to see a burger that looks picture-perfect. The bun was fluffy, and all the toppings were perfectly set atop the burger. No sign of being run over with a steam roller. The fries were good too. They were not greasy nor salty. Crispy and hot. I definitely recommend this place if you have a burger hankering and need it on the cheap. Great quality for a good price.",

In the context of a basic burger place that's next to a university that mainly serves hungry students, this place gets 5 stars. I ordered a bacon cheeseburger and it was picture-perfect with everything that i wanted in it. The fries were absolutely delicious, crunchy with a nice earthy, potato flavor that doesn't fall short. I ate all of it without any ketchup, and trust me I usually douse my fries in ketchup. Would come back if I lived in the area.",

That already was a bit unnerving but we continued to keep eating there being a favorited place between the 2 of us in all, in also never having an issue with the food or service. The overall up-keep & presentation of the place seemed it's usual which is pretty clean & organized, until just a few weeks ago we both became a bit ill after eating there in both having burgers & fries (go figure). I felt a bit of a stomach ache in having a slight sensation of literally wanting to vomit fry oil during the night, & my friend didn't fair that much better that same night either. We decided to not go back after that & haven't been back since in it being almost 3 weeks now. The service is however ALWAYS good, as was the food (for the most part) & yes they finally serve milkshakes as well as a list of other new items & such (which is the 3 star rating). But I sure don't wanna feel that way again anytime soon & until that, \"okay\" is changed to a \"good or excellent\" we'll pass on the stomach illness deluxe.",

This was my being 2nd time in Seattle and it just wasn't a good experience from the moment I tried to take my flight so I was craving a burger to calm my nerves. The reviews and distance was the main reason I chose this spot. Everything leans towards it sounding like an amazing burger joint. From the moment you walk in you'll notice it's pretty spacious with an old school feel for the area where they prep your food. They've got many options so I built my burger which ended up just being a cheeseburger with onions, lettuce, pickles the standard burger,The Price are pretty generous for the amount of food you get. Not a fan of Â steak fries which is what I was served. I don't remember looking into other options so i'm not sure if that's all they serve. The burger was not too big not too small. The only thing I have a real complaint about is the flavoring for the burger was kind of off. It was cooked thoroughly but it was pretty dry. The three stars are for a pretty clean restaurant, with quick and attentive staff, food being served pretty quick and well presented and decent quality",

The sauce was extremely salty and sour, and there was too much of it. It was disgusting. I had never had kimchi fried rice like this before and I've eaten many kimchi fried rice dishes (even made my own).

Â Some of the pieces were a little chewy, but that could've been due drive from there to Green Lake. Regardless, it was very flavorful, with a very mild lamb flavor. Â Despite some chewy pieces, it was mostly tender. Â The accompanying salad was a nice refreshing flavor burst that complemented the meat. Â The rice is good and there's just the right amount of rice for meat (meat to rice ratio is good). Â And the hummus and pita are really good. Â The yogurt sauce is creamy and provides a nice textural element to the meat, as well as a nice herby/garlic flavor too. You get two pitas with your order and I think you could do with a little more hummus for the amount of pita that you get - but I'm not complaining. Â I just love Â the pitas that Mr Gyros uses and hummus is quite smooth. Â All-in-all, it's my favorite Mediterranean plate in Seattle. The Mr Gyro Greek Salad is always very good. Â You get a generous portion of meat and fresh vegetables, chopped into perfect bite sized pieces. Â It's a really refreshing and flavorful salad. The Greek fries are just generic thick-cut fries with a nice sprinkle of different seasonings and feta. But it's a nice snack. Â They aren't the best fries that I've had, but I always seem to over indulge. In addition to the great food the service is excellent.

    "review": "On campus, when the food options are over priced and mundane, MR GYROS saves the day!! It's honestly my favorite gyro sandwich. The portion size is ridiculous and they fill it with I'd say triple the normal amount of meat of normal places. For $8 it's a steal at school. They later the lamb and beef on a warm pita with tstaskiki (I can't spell it I'm sorry!!) sauce and hummus- added bonus! Most places charge for this. Also, the meat is so tender and juicy yet it has that nice crisp outer layer. It keeps me sustained all day and I'm able to focus better. The greens are fresh and crisp. On a college student budget this is really a saving grace. I look forward to seeing the little green food truck when I have hunger pangs!!",

Keep in mind that this place is small, so no need to bring a large group for lunch. There are about 5 tables at this location and 4 bar top seats looking out at the street view. The service is speedy fast, and the food is authentic, flavorful, and so delicious. We all ended up getting the lamb&beef gyro, which came wrapped up nicely in foil and split in half. This is a monster gyro normally (last time I remember having this gryo), so I'm grateful they cut it for us. The meat packs a punch and is wonderfully tender. That secret sauce (which I think may be rooster sauce and ketchup) just seals the deal! Make your way over to Mr. Gyros for a quick lunch to experience their amazing gyros!!",

The best part are the free-to-play arcade games, though the volume on these machines should come down a skosh. The business is on a busy corner and adjacent the lobby of a hotel. I can imagine location sending this place's stocks through the stratesphere.As of this moment, it's a decent place to study (though the game volume and the vacuuming in the hotel lobby, and the echoey space itself can provide ample distraction, bring your noise cancellers) but I can see that unravelling when they get popular.And one more thing! This usually knocks off more than one star for me, but my cup of coffee has turned out to be so [expletive deleted] delicious. The price!!!! It's astronomical! An 8 ounce cup of drip is $3.30!!!! It isn't even a single origin. That IS enough to keep me from coming back, honestly, even though I've given them 4 stars. Also, currently, one of their video games is busted. You can't even play it. I'm not sure if they ever intend on fixing it and I shouldn't complain because it's free, but perhaps the price of the games are built in to their coffee prices? So then I am complaining.I think, if you're a connoisseur of fine coffee and throw-back kung-fu video games, this place is worth a one time visit.

Kimchi Tofu Soup with Beef (Medium): Medium wasn't all that spicy and there was a lot of beef in this dish. The broth was a bit on the oilier side. The purple rice on the side was also hard and crispy. The portion size was perfect for me. I was pretty stuffed after one soup.

I haven't had any experience dining in - the 3 or 4 times I've done, I've ordered take out. As such, I can't speak to the level of service at all, and I can only review this place based on the food itself and the value.My go-to order would have to be the Galbitang. It's good, don't get me wrong, and for someone that craves Galbitang on a cold day, this one hits the spot. However, it's not amazing by any means. It's not going to be a meal that'll leave you speechless by how delicious it is - it's just good. One thing I'll note is that because I've gotten takeout, they actually put all the soup in a takeout container, which they then wrap a plastic bag around. Because of this, soup can spill out of the takeout container into the bag, leaving a bit of a mess when you unravel it all to finally eat.I also tried the spicy kimchi pork bowl on my last visit, but I found it to be pretty spicy (spicier than regular spicy korean dishes). Nothing really stood out about the dish either - they overloaded my order with rice, and the egg was overcooked. This place can be on the more expensive side, but I think it's because with every order, you get a bunch of side dishes too. However, for one person, I actually think they give too much food, and so I find myself paying for food that I don't even end up eating. I wish they had cheaper/smaller entree dishes.There's street parking right outside the restaurant and throughout the surrounding area. Be wary of going during peak hours, as college kids tend to flock here from what I've seen. Also, the loud korean music that they play indicates that this is more of a late-night spot to go with friends, and by no means should it serve any other purpose. If you're really carving Korean, this place doesn't hurt to try, but just be aware that there may be better options out there.",

Their kimchi is okay.Given the location, value is pretty decent. Most of the soon dubu dishes are full meals when eaten together with rice and all the provided for banchan, and after tax and tip you are coming in at just over $10, which seems to be about right.The service is extremely mixed. There are a couple individuals there that are consistently rude and abrasive, while others are much more friendly and helpful.

It was a huge portion not including all the banchan it came with. Veggies were fresh and the beef was tender and overall flavorful. I'm not typically a huge fan of all the banchan but they had yummy spicy kimchi, pickled cucumbers, and some teriyaki potatoes that were pretty darn tasty. The mac salad had waaaay too much mayo for my liking. All in all good food though. After I took a seat they tried to take my order within seconds - fine, but at least let me take a peek at the menu! After my food arrived I was never checked on again. Can't give more than the 3 stars due to service. The place is small so it fills up fast. Luckily I had just come after most of the lunch rush and found seating OK. You pay up front as soon as your finished (they did not bring a bill).",

Their regular side dishes include potatoes, kimchi, bean sprouts, fish cake, cucumbers, and macaroni salad. I especially like their potatoes because you can taste the flavor of soy sauce mixed with a little sweetness, and the texture of potatoes gives a really great taste! Also, it is nice how you can ask for refills of the side dishes for free, and any time I asked for a refill on a side dish, it came right away. I ordered a galbi + tofu soup combo. The galbi was served with onions and it was quite delicious. The tofu soup was extremely flavorful as well. Â  I am usually picky when it comes to tofu soup, but the soft tofu soup here has a very rich base, and it is not overly salty so you can eat it alone or with rice. My personal favorite is their gut (intestine) tofu soup, and I love how they serve purple rice instead of white rice.The service was also quite nice- very attentive and quick. The waiters were friendly and precise. I appreciated how they offered to refill my water even before I asked them. I have been to other tofu places on the ave, but this is absolutely my favorite place to go. I highly recommend this place!",

Just as I kept discreetly drooling while walking down the ave, I picked up a scent of SOONDUBU!! Yes!! I began to unleash my sniffing ability to track down the source of the smell anddd that's how I ended up at Kong Tofu House. Jk, I already planned to go hereGiven the proximity to UW campus, this place is easily spotted and gets super packed during lunch hours. My friend and I couldn't find any seats and we were told to order our food first. Just right after we were seated, our food came. The total wait time was only 10 minutes, that's considerably quick! I like the efficient system here! I would recommend getting the entree combo (1 entree + 1 assorted soondubu) since it has better value. The price of the entree itself is more expensive than the combo. We had beef bulgogi combo + pork bulgogi combo. Both bulgogi weren't the best bulgogi but still tasty and satiating. The beef one was slightly sweeter and the pork was both sweet and salty. The banchan (side dishes) were decent as well. Moving on to the best part, the soondubu!! The silky and smooth tofu was bathed in spicy soup Â packed with beef, shrimp, and clam. Everything about the soup was phenomenal! Service was exceptional as well! A great quick fix for your korean food craving!",

My friend and I spotted this food truck, as it was the truck that was parked outside of Optimism Brewery when we visited. Â You always need bites with your beer; and when she found out that Off the Rez was here, she was excited to try their fry bread. Â I had never eaten fry bread before, but was down to try something new. My friend ordered the Powwow Burger, a bacon cheeseburger with fry bread for buns, while I had two Indian tacos, one with pork and the other with chicken. Â Menu was pretty standard with taco and burger combinations, with sides like kale salad and fries. My Indian tacos were A-OK. Â Don't get me wrong - the fry bread was awesome! Â It was soft and fluffy and had crispy edges. Â I would've happily just eaten it by itself. Â But getting it as a taco, to sandwich the meat and toppings seemed to distract from the real winner of Off The Rez, the fry bread. Â Both of my meats, chicken and pork were bland. Â You'd think that with the toppings it wouldn't be so, but they were. Â My chicken taco included shredded cheese and slaw in a crema sauce while the pork one had a BBQ sauce with slaw and was supposed to have jalapenos, but sadly, they must've forgot to put it on. Â The sauces did help to add some flavor to the tacos, but meat just never came through. Â My friend felt the same way about her Powwow Burger, saying that the beef patty tasted like it wasn't seasoned. Â I advise getting a sweet fry bread item instead of a savory dish, in hopes that it fares much better. Â The fry bread was really good, so the simpler the toppings, the better.",

Weird.\" But the flavors weren't crazy - just an interesting twist on burgers and tacos using fry bread.Anyway, I got a powwow burger. I feel like that is offensive in some way, but I don't know. Anyway - it had fry bread as the bun, a single beef Patty (flat top style, fully cooked... 1/4 pound), bacon, other normal burger stuff, and cumin crema. It was a solid burger. Juicy meat. Good bacon. The frybread bun was awkwardly big and I couldn't help but feel the burger would have been better off without it. It was rich, bready, and kind of what you'd expect. Not Â super greasy, but definitely heavy. They had ketchup. Tapatio, and Sriracha to go with their stuff. I also got fries, and they were medium sized, maybe edging on shoestring.

Â Despite being the center of the universe in the 15th century, the region is still largely unknown to the average American, so it came as a surprise to learn my wife was stopping by the new Fitchi House to bring home a few Turkmeni delicacies, including the eponymous house specialty the Fitchi, which the website describes as \"a take on Turkmen traditional dish Ishlekli (Islekli)\". Â The Fitchi itself was delicious with a tasty meat filling (I suspect Vegans may be out of luck at the Fitchi House). The pastry was crispy and light. The filling also included quite a bit of broth that enhanced the taste but at the expense of serving as grab and go items - eat with a plate close at hand and a few napkins. Â We also had one Somsa, which we both found tasty; a distant cousin to the Samosas found on the other end of the Silk Road, I suspect. Perhaps it was this relationship that had me wishing for a little sauce to accompany it. The filling was similar to the Fitchi, however with a denser pastry shell, and it paired well. Still brothy and in need of that plate.Fitchi House appears to be following the \"build the airplane as you fly it\" approach to their development process, so there were a few noticeable miscues: our 6 Fitchi/1 Somsa combo started out as a 3 and 3, and my wife left convinced she had agreed to a 4 and 2, but somehow we picked up a couple of Fitchis and lost a Somsa; a website that still pays a bit too much homage to Lorem ipso and needs some focused dev time; and potential brand confusion (the owner still manages the predecessor business, Milano Pizza, out of the location). I am also hopeful other fillings might be in the offing. Â As it is, there is a risk of the menu being a bit one note. Nevertheless, it's hard to be too critical about a chance to eat this cuisine without the hassle of flying all the way to Ashgabat. Now all I need is a little kumis...",

The pneer burger is my favorite. It has a tangy paneer slice and some basic veggies and mayo. It simple yet pleases the taste buds pretty well. The chicken masala burger was good too, a bit spicier than the paneer one but good. I could move to Seattle just for their burgers.Service: very quick Service. You could see the people working in the kitchen and you'll be amazed at how fast they can whip up these burgers. It's like one of those video games where you have to deliver orders within a time limit. And yet all their orders are equally delicious.Ambiance: it's a hole in the wall place which you might miss if you weren't looking exactly for. Not much seating, maybe 5-7 tables in a small room. So I guess this place is better for takeout. In-all: I think you can guess that I am a fan. And this place is going to be a must do on my list whenever I'm in Seattle.

Their medium spicy level is usually really really hot for some people. Pair it with a milk shake (vanilla milk shake is my personal favorite). I did not dare to try high spicy level yet.I have lived in 3 major cities in India, but have never found a place which makes such burgers with pure Indian taste. Burger is not an indian thing. But these guys have a created an amazing fusion which tastes as if you are eating an authentic Indian curry with a bread.I have no complains about the place.Just don't expect anything from the ambience.

I appreciate the effort but I didn't think it worked. The paneer, however, stole my heart. It was SOOO GOODDD! The sauce they use on this burger was something special. It tied all the ingredients together, add a slight sweetness and blended so well with the tiny saltiness of the cheese that made meat lovers forget for a minute that this burger meatless. The cheese, which almost tasted like cottage cheese but had a mozzarella texture, hold itself together very well, not falling apart as one ate the burger.

You can adjust the spice level according to your taste but like Indian food it's on the spicy side so note that while placing an order. Fries are fresh with ample chaat masala powder(mixed spice seasoning) that really makes it stand out. The veggie burger is to die for! The patty is crispy and melt in your mouth all at the same time. The bun used are crisped a little bit and that adds up to the texture of it. The spicy garlic dressing/chutney elevated the taste of the burger. My friends enjoyed their chicken burger and went on for another serving of it! Their chocolate shakes are one of the best that I have had and it's a good place to fulfill your parathas(stuffed flatbread) craving!!This place is value for money with amazing food! Bon appetit!",

The waiters are on the younger side, and have been particularly nice, but the cashier can rub you the wrong way pretty easily or not at all - just from my experience (not speaking for anyone else of course), if you're not Korean you will be treated a bit differently. Maybe its how I look...not really sure what the reason is, but I definitely never had that \"nice Korean lady\" service everyone spoke of.QUALITYIt's good, and has been fairly consistent - I have yet to experience a bad dish in the many times I've eaten there. It's definitely on the better end of Korean food on campus, and the barley tea is a very nice touch since the aroma is definitely addicting. Just keep in mind that getting a dish to-go will probably not be in your best interest since it doesn't seem to fare very well after a 15 min walk back to your dorm.OVERALLIt's not bad, but it's not the greatest either. If you're a UW student craving Korean food, then this is definitely the place to go to (unless something else popped up, or you're okay with commuting to Lynnwood). Just remember that it is on the pricier side of things, and you might be caught a little off guard if you're not too wealthy.",

Â I brought it home, dumped it on a clean plate and started eating. Â It wasn't until I ate about 75% of it that I noticed a black thing with legs. Â It was a COCKROACH. Â I am so completely upset and disgusted both at the same time. Â I must have eaten some of that cockroach because some of the legs were missing. I called the restaurant and of course, they apologized. Â They offered to refund me my money or to comp a future dish. Â Seriously? Who in their right mind would eat here again after this kind of experience? No, I'm not going to go back there and get my money back because it isn't worth my time. Â What I hoped to hear was that he would tell me how he would correct the issue so that future guests wouldn't encounter this problem. Â After I got my angst out, I started to google \"what happens if you eat some cockroaches?\" Apparently, they are really dirty creatures and crawl around in a lot of gross stuff. Â They carry bacteria and other stuff. Â I threw up after reading that. Â There is no excuse for something like this to happen. This is completely unacceptable. Â I will never come here again.",

Iys not THE absolute best I've ever had in all time or even in Seattle but it is definitely a reliably good Korean food that's casual and accessible for us Seattleites that don't want to trek out to Federal Way for the good stuff. Side note: I always like to know if my Yelp writer actually has clout and cam legitimately judge an ethnic restaurant. Â I'm Korean and have been eating Korean food since I was little, so there ya go. The dolsot bibimbap is one of the highlights - generous portions of all the different vegetables and really well seasoned and flavorful! Could use a little more meat and leave it in the pot for a little more crispy rice, but those are little details. Â Overall really good and just $9.95.The kimchi jigae is pretty good and has a great flavor with just the right amount of kick. Tofu and big tasty morsels of well seasoned beef are highlights. Â Would like it a little thicker and sweeter but just my personal prefs.The bulgogi is delish. The duk mandoo guk is on par too. Love the mild flavor, yummy dumplings, Â and the perfectly al dente duk.Ban chans aren't the greatest except for the kungnamul which is really nicely done. Â Kimchi is a little more well done than I like (not as crispy and fresh as other places) and the fish cake is not that good actually. I like lots of different ban chans and they only give 4 different kinds. But it's more a quick dine place vs a fancier sit down Korean restaurant so it's fine.Service is good and people overall friendly and attentive, cleaning tables quickly and bringing orders pretty quickly. Definitely my go to spot for a quick weeknight Korean dinner that's accessible and close for those in the udistrict, Â fremont, wallingford hood. Definitely highly recommend you check this out!! :)",

They were pretty busy, so they were cooking the food quickly, but they could've mixed the seasoning better. I chose 3 stars for the spice level, and it was not spicy at all.

Yes, we may have been in a hurry, but in no way did we give him attitude and acted in away that was deserving of that type of service. He didn't stop and listen to what I had to say. He had his back towards me the whole time, and when I was done all he said was he appreciates the feedback. I asked for a manager or supervisor (because at this point it was clear he wasn't sympathetic and really didn't care if he had offended anyone). That's when he told me I had to leave.

A friend of mine ordered the currywurst: a large plate with a depressing sausage atop sauerkraut plus a ton of fries and curry-flavored ketchup. $12 seemed steep for a standard hot dog sized sausage and a potato or two for all those fries. I think presentation would have been a lot more pleasant if the plate weren't the size of a serving platter. It brought unwanted attention to the small size of the sausage. The color of the ketchup also threw me off. You'd think with all of the curry flavor, it would not look just like regular ketchup. Some turmeric would have really helped to distinguish the curry ketchup from the standard Heinz. The atmosphere was super fun, with low lighting and dark wood everywhere, plus a ton of sports and alcohol brand memorabilia.

All the natural light keeps this place and the staff upbeat and friendly. Also doesn't make you feel as bad for day drinking when you can enjoy the sun instead of hiding from it. Plus you're really able to take in the decorations that give off a truly German feel. Happy hour is from 3-6 on weekdays and all day Sundays. I recommend the Currywurst for a happy hour meal (comes with a ton of fries!) and the Moscow Mule for a drink (only 5.50 during the summertime). The only thing I don't like about the happy hour is that you can only get happy hour price on food if you buy a drink with it. So I always end up spending more than I want to. Also the prices here have gone up here quiet a bit since I first started coming here about 5 years ago. But not surprised since it's in a prime location and restaurants tend to turn over pretty fast on the Ave. I'm a sucker for German bars and this is by far my favorite one in the city of Seattle. If you're in the area definitely stop by.",

I reluctantly ordered a sausage burger which came with a side of the \"world's best fries\"... I kind of hate them for claiming they're the world's best and then actually kind of delivering on it. I mean, they'd probably be better if they were covered in shaved truffles, but for a basic french fry, I gotta say I was actually impressed and am hard pressed to remember a better fry I've had anywhere in the world. Which is totally annoying, but I'll give credit where it is due. The sausage burger was tasty, not dry, yet not overly greasy. Service was good too, which is strange for \"The Ave.\" They had TVs so you can watch the World Cup while eating.",

If on the outside it seems like it may just be another dressed up hotdogs buns, but once inside we realize this is a legit German bar with a good beer selection and some really boss sausages.On Seahawk game days they have an all day happy hour which included some really good deals on a number of different dishes. They have self-proclaimed best fries in the world, and while that may be a bit of an overstatement, they were really good. They're more than happy to dress Them up with plenty of bacon and cheese if you like!My wife and I split the Currywurst as well as a standard Bratwurst. Both were quite good. Our kids shared a hotdog and some fries. As previously stated, the fries were actually delicious. Maybe not the best on earth, but certainly the best we've had in the last month or so.The beer selection here is pretty solid. Especially around Oktoberfest time, they have tons of different seasonal else with a focus on many from with in the state as well as a number from Germany.I'm not totally sure what I was expecting year, but this definitely exceeded what I thought we would find. Things were not overly expensive, the happy hour was solid and it was OK to be having a beer at 11:30 in the morning after walking a 5K with friends! Definitely worth checking out.",

When we started coming here in the beginning, service was great, the staff was fun to talk to and get to know, but recently we have had lack luster service. My personal experience includes one time when I ordered a drink and never got it. Brought it up during the next visit, and was offered a free drink. My most recent experience was tonight, 1/29/2019. The group of friends and I all sat down and did our normal thing, I ordered a drink, which came and I ordered food... which didn't come. When it was time to closeout our tab, I paid mine and then asked the server if they had written down my order. They responded that they didn't have my ticket on their notebook anymore. I then asked if they remembered me ordering the specific food items (which I repeated back what I had ordered). I told them that they never came. Their response was that I should have reminded them about my order. I shouldn't have to remind you about my order, that is why you right it down!!. Anyway.. you lost me as a customer and my group that follows me.One of my group patrons had issues with their drinks. Could not taste alcohol in it.. So with all this said and done, at the end of the night, you lost several customers in 1 fail Swoop! -Deuces ~ V",

The flavor was lacking, and the toppings did little to add to the flavor of the sausage as a whole. The coleslaw was also lacking flavor. It could've used any salt, pepper, maybe even some vinegar. The outside seating area was also a little cramped. It was shaded though so that's nice. It seemed like a cool place to chill when there's not a lot of people. If it was busy, I'd rather not.

If you can't take spicy, I would not even try the \"less spicy option\" and just go for \"not spicy.\" The scallion pancakes were very oily but lacked scallions. The portions were large but mainly when it comes to the noodles...I feel like they skimped on the lettuce in the noodle soup (only got 2 pieces) and not as much meat.A few things to note:+ You order on a menu with a dry erase marker.

I've consistently noticed that the food items are usually 20-30 cents to even a dollar cheaper for some items than what is sold at other stores. The vitamin selection here is good, and they carry the affordable and effective Deva brand, as well as a few others. I was able to purchase vegan prenatal vitamins which worked wonderfully for my pregnancy. They also had a variety of protein powders, and one that was just plain hemp protein (or was it pea protein?) that I devoured when I was pregnant and didn't want any added flavors or vitamins.If you are gluten free, they have a lot of GF and vegan items ranging from noodles, my favorite Leahey mac and cheese, to hemp tofu (pretty darn good!), to GF tempeh (legit and super good!). The staff can also order stuff for you in bulk if you ask.The store also has a solid selection of household cleaners and even soapnuts and toilet paper. If you're looking for vegan pet food (cat and dog), you'll find it here. They also sell a super potent cat nip toy for $2 that all my cats have loved. I'm not sure who makes them, but I've been buying them for years.The book selection here is also excellent! There are a ton of cookbooks, books on veganism, animal rights, to books for children and toddlers. I purchased a few books for my son, which he has taken a liking to, by chewing on them.If you're a new vegan, or a long time vegan, or someone just checking things out, the staff here are super friendly!

Vegan Haven is Vegan Heaven to those who are vegan, who have allergies or diet restrictions like no dairy, or who just want to introduce more plant-based foods into their diet. It is densely packed from ceiling to floor with vegan items that are difficult or impossible to find, even at other stores that carry like items. There's also just good, scrummy edibles here for anyone. I had a hard time just moving past the front entrance area--there was a lot of chocolate there, haha. I was so happy to find jackfruit here, not in the limited preseasoned packages at those \"other\" big stores, but in the best form--unseasoned, canned--so you can season it and cook it to your liking. I bought a bunch of cans of the green fruit (for savory meals) and used their organic taco and enchilada seasoning packets to make the BEST vegan tacos/burritos, oh my!! Then, they also had the ripe jackfruit in their frozen section that I can't wait to try: Looks like a peeled mango, supposedly tastes like a combination mango, pineapple and peach, yum! Jackfruit entered the American vegan scene in 2017, (although it's been around in Asia and India forever) and is making a huge splash because it tastes great! I'm sure the larger stores will catch up, but I'm forever loyal to this store for having it first in both forms. But that's not the only reason I'm a new regular, by no means your honor!They had more great stuff than I can possibly mention! I really loved just how many different nondairy milks they had that I didn't even know existed. I recently found out from Maria, the owner and amazing chef of La Antigua Casa Maria in Seattle, that horchatas are not pure rice milk drinks--they actually have some condensed dairy milk, traditionally, and I was bummed. But then I saw here that Rice Dream makes a horchata pure rice milk--that went straight in my cart! They have great non-foods items too, such as the two fabulous looking vegan cookbooks I found that I can't wait to try. By the time I got out of that store, I was loaded down like a pack mule.I was really impressed with the vibe in here. It was so friendly and upbeat. The employees, being all volunteer except the manager, are there because they believe in the cause (supporting an animal sanctuary), so they are there simply because they want to be. This makes them very friendly and outgoing. Even the customers were nice, bumping into a couple of them while distracted, lol. There was an overall sense of good cheer and camaraderie pervading the place, making it a pleasure to shop there. Kudos Vegan Heaven--er, Haven!",

Actually what inspired me to finally write this was Squirrel & Crow's (Portland!) post that VH started carrying their tempeh in 3 flavors. In addition to that, I've gotten the Beanfield chips, Butler soy curls, Oatly oat milk (when restocked, lol, cuz demand is in waves), I think a few more food items. Oh, some awesome stickers, too! I try to make it an effort and come here from time-to-time because it's really cool and there's no where like it remotely nearby.

There is seating on the inside but I think a lot of people seemed to be getting takeout?I ordered the chicken shawarma wrap and the others got the gyro plate. I am soooo happy I got the shawarma wrap because DAYUM the pita bread here is insanely delicious. So fluffy and soft and warm and thickety thick thick. There's nothing I hate more than hella dry pita so I was very impressed with theirs. It almost has more of the texture of naan than your usual grocery store type pita bread. The chicken was also so juicy and flavorful and the hummus in it was bomb. My combo came with either rice, salad, or fries and although I wanted their tasty looking fries I opted for their rice. Also freaking good and it comes with this cucumber looking yogurt sauce (it's a yogurt sauce that's slightly green, no idea whats in it) that was SO GOOD!! Loved it.The gyro (lamb and beef) was also really delish. Their plate came with a salad, which I took a few bites of, and again, also bomb.com. The dressing wasn't oily and was very tart and refreshing which complemented the heavier meats. I will DEFINITELY come back here if I'm craving shawarma in the future!!",

The salad had tons of cucumber, onion, and tomatoes and was COVERED in meet. The whole thing is topped with crumbled feta, olive oil, and Middle Eastern dressing. If you have a problem with this salad, you are a big dumb. 3. The falafel is moist and not dry at all, which is different from all the other Arab restaurants I've had in this city, where the falafel is dry and disgusting. Buy this food.",

We stopped in after mentioning that we had a craving for a gyro before going to an event at the University and this place hit the spot.Everything is made fresh on a small grill right behind the cash register, so you'll have to wait a few minutes for your order (it's worth it). They have gyros, shawarmas, kebabs, and veggie options so everyone can find something they like.I had a classic gyro with falafel added and it was awesome. Huge sandwich stuffed with meat, falafel, feta, lettuce, and tomato (no onion for me) topped with a homemade tzatziki. I shared a side of fries, but they are on the smaller side, so if you're really hungry you could definitely eat your own. The only thing that turned me off was the cleanliness of the bathroom. It was pretty gross and in no way changes my rating of the food, but an FYI if you need to use it while you dine here.",

I'm going to compare this to Aladdin's (43rd) since that's the most famous/popular place on the Ave. Surprisingly, this place is very good and I would say is comparable to Aladdin's. Sultan definitely beats Aladdin's in terms of price, being $1-2 cheaper on each item and the taste was just as good if not better, making it a better value in my opinion. However, the only thing preventing it from being 5 stars was the ambience. I can't say much about the actual hygiene of the place since they do have a good health rating, but upon walking in, I was bombarded by a swarm of flies, and while waiting for my food, was constantly being annoyed by flies. While the hygiene might be fine, it wasn't a pleasant experience actually being inside the restaurant. Good food and value, bad environment. Would recommend trying though.",

Chicken shawarma is also amazing. I cross the bridge from the east side just to eat here. Would def recommend!",

A couple minutes later, he came out with a bowl of chicken pho. we told him that this wasn't what we ordered, we had ordered a steak pho. he responded angrily and started to shout and point at me saying, \"YOU CHANGED THE ORDER!!! YOU CHANGED IT TO CHICKEN!!!!!\" I then explained that I had requested a pork banh mi and to change the size of the pho, not the actual pho order. He disagreed and kept arguing that I had changed it. My friend who overheard me at the counter (the restaurant was completely empty except for 1 other customer and dead quiet) backed me up. He continued to argue. We then asked if he could please switch it to the steak. He responded angrily and said,\"Well its your choice. Its going in the trash then though.\" and walked away. He didnt want to help us and acted really pissed off. My friend and I felt really uncomfortable and didnt know what to do. I continued to drink my coffee but we decided we would not eat the pho. A few minutes later the man noticed we werent eating it and got really angryand started to accuse me again. I told him it was a misunderstanding and I did not ask for chicken pho. He kept pointing and yelling at me and by this time, a woman customer had sat down in the restaurant and observed the whole thing. She also looked very uncomfortable. I kept telling him it was a misunderstanding and then he told me he would only change the pho if I would admit that I lied to him. I told him I did not lie and it was a misunderstanding. He grabbed the pho and went to the back of the restaurant, extremely pissed and kept shouting that I was a liar. My friend and I sat there baffled until we decided I would pay for the coffee I drank and we would cancel the meal. i told the man this and he rang me up for the coffee but kept telling me I was a liar and he didnt like customers like me. I continued to tell him it was just a misunderstanding. I also asked him why I would purposefully lie to him to mke him change my order? He said \"NO DONT GIVE ME THAT, DONT GIVE ME THAT! YOU ARE A LIAR!!!!\" So after I paid, we left very confused and angry. No wonder the restaurant was completely empty... We ended up going to Pho Shizzle after and it was great.",

Although pho thy thy was the first pho place I went to with my boyfriend when we first started dating, it unfortunately is the one I wasn't a fan of. Don't get me wrong though, pho thy thy gets a gold medal for fastest food. I swear we ordered and then our food just came. It didn't take longer than a minute - literally. Pho thy thy gives you a few options on sizes: small, medium, large and extra large. I normally get the pho that has everything in it (brisket, flank, tendon, tripe, meatballs) but pho thy thy actually doesn't have a combo pho that comes with meatballs. So there were no meatballs in mine - bummer. Honestly the biggest turn off for me was the fact that the broth lacked so much flavor. The broth had an extremely subtle taste and so it left me feeling like I wasn't really eating authentic pho. They give you the general sides of bean sprouts, jalapeÃ±os and basil. However, they actually don't give you any lime. Instead, they have lime juice in a bottle for you to use. I personally would rather squeeze in my own natural lime, but I understand that since people don't use lime sometimes, it can be wasteful. The things that were good about this place. For one they had the mini sauce dishes at every table so you didn't have to ask them for it. They also give you a decent amount of meat and full portions of tendon and tripe. These pieces were full and big so it seemed more authentic. Other than that, the broth really turned me off and will be the reason why I don't come back.

All in all, they are very stingy and give you surprisingly bad service. Better to other places on the Ave!",

I remembered this place because my friend loves their tiramisu and she always refers it as \"the blue house across from Starbuck\". I used to go there a lot when I was living on campus and were too lazy to go up on the Ave. I like their main dishes - simple but delicious. I think the owner is a young couple and I'm always amazed by how fast they serve the food given the fact that they don't have many chefs. Despite their tasty meals, the portion is small compared to what they charge you, so I stop going after my freshman year. However I do think it's a warm and nice place for a quick lunch/dinner. As for the tiramisu, I learned that they pre-make them and freeze it. So don't get the one that's just out of the freezer as it's cold and hard.",

It is located in Red Square next to a barbecue and hot dog truck. The foot traffic made it pretty clear that this was the most popular of the bunch.There are several Hawaiian plate lunch classics on the menu here including kalua pork and Korean barbecued chicken. In addition, there is haupia, Spam musubi and two slider sandwiches (kalua pork and Spam) which take a page from the Marination Mobile/Station playbook.I decided to give the large kalua pig plate a try ($6 for the large, $3.50 for the small). Do note that they don't take cash here! They only take plastic which is interesting. UW resident dining card, Husky card or Visa/Mastercard. It does make some sense since they charged tax on the meal and it did help expedite the order/pick-up process.The kalua pig large plate comes with two scoops white rice and macaroni salad. It is a substantial meal, though smaller than other Hawaiian places. Still, the price is right and it does fill you up.The food itself was borderline. The meat was decent, though it was incredibly fatty. There were numerous chunks of fat in the dish. The kalua pork did not come with any cabbage which would have helped to tame some of the pork's saltiness. The macaroni salad was okay. I would say slightly below average. The flavor seemed a bit off. The plate had no real veggies to speak of so this is a complete carb/protein fest. I know, I know. This is Hawaiian food, but still it would be nice if it had some greens. We are talking about a mostly student clientele here for goodness sakes!While the food wasn't great, the price is decent and it is located on campus. It makes more sense to eat here than having to head over to University Way if you need to get a bite before a class. It is not like the food on University Way is that much better, in value and in taste than what you would find at Motosurf.",

I really like the kalua pork due to the saltiness and hint of smokey taste to it. I would love this even more if there was cabbage but the meat was fine with me. The mac salad was good too. I thought the green onions were a nice touch to it. I even had leftovers of this meal due to my spam slider! Haupia Custard ($1.50) I thought this was alright. Some parts were nice and creamy while there were some watery parts. I probably wouldn't order this again. Pretty dang good for $7 huh? Interestingly enough, this place is CARDS ONLY.

One time my order took a little longer than usual in the hub motosurf(maybe like 1 minute more) and they didn't charge me for my spam slider. The old person working there is so friendly and makes food super fast.Here's some stuff I have gotten:SPAM MUSUBIThis runs out pretty quick. The subtle sweetness of the rice balances out how salty spam normally is. I tried making spam musubi and it wasn't half as good as how they make it. I also compared it to spam musubi on the ave, this place does the rice better. This is hands down my favorite thing to get from them! I just need to hold back on it if I wanna go on a diet! :)KALUA PIGThis is probably their most popular item because everyone gets it. The shredded pork is well flavored, soft, and delicious. A lot of people like to put the teriyaki sauce and sriracha outside the truck on the meat. The mac salad is pretty good, I'm normally not a fan of macaroni salad. I often replace it with kimchi. Their kimchi reminds me of kimchi I eat at home, and it makes me less homesick because it's so good! The rice is your typical white rice that goes soooo well with the meat.SPAM SLIDERThere's some slaw on this that's pretty sweet, and I like it a lot. The slaw is like the almost sweet rice, and it again cuts out the salty flavor spam usually has. The bread is not toasted but it's soft and chewy. It's a very cute little sandwich. KOREAN CHICKENI actually hate chicken because of the texture, but I find myself eating this sometimes because it goes well with kimchi. The chicken is soft and moist, covered with a sauce that's more teriyaki like than what I'd consider to be BBQ. It's not my favorite because it's still chicken, but I like it.

Let me tell y'all the story of a young man in college that had the thought, \"you know what, I haven't had my weekly fix of Kalua pork, let me get this going.\" My craving juices were flowing and I donned my favorite pair of walking socks as I prepared for the journey into Red Square. As I was making my way downtown, faces passing, anticipating my food, I began to imagine myself eating this wonderful meal once I was back in my own home. I would toss on some Netflix, watch Malcolm in the Middle, and chill with my meal. Definite to have a smile on my face and a twinkle in my heart's eye. Anyway, I digress, I waited in line for roughly 5 minutes, with a lady in front of me. She seemed nice...at first. That was until after I gave her a nice smile and she decided to look me in the eye, not return my friendly gesture, and look away. All while she decided it necessary to hold her giant a$$ suitcase closer to her body. Lady I don't want your damn suitcase, I just want Kalua pork. Also, why do you have a suitcase in the first place? I should have taken this as an omen for my impending shortcomings, yet instead, like a fool, I stayed and endured extreme disappointment. LET IT BE KNOWN, I do not hold Motosurf accountable for this lady's rudeness. As a renowned Yelp reviewer (yes, just another title I have earned, feel free to use it in further interactions), I just believe you, the general public, deserve to know the full extent of my food experience at the establishment known as Motosurf. Once I was at the window ordering my food, free of the emotionally draining fetters that the lady in front attempted to place on my soul, I ordered my usual meal. My lines here were probably as follows:\"Yes, hello good sir, I would like a uhhh large Kalua. Yes, all fried rice, friend. No, I am not available to debate the existence of the universe with you at this time. Maybe later when we meat up for our annual burger off ;)\"I stood back from the window and smiled internally, commending myself on yet another good instance of ordering at this establishment. Finally, I got my food and decided to walk back home. Maaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaan that food was smelling exquisite and my salivary glands hit the simony dance in my mouth as I was thinking about the meal ahead of me. I even thought, \"you know what, let me hit the store and buy myself some top quality teriyaki sauce to drizzle on my pork.\" returning to my room roughly 20 minutes older and a teriyaki sauce richer, I settled in. Sat down, took my socks and hoodie off, got my show ready, and drizzled on just 3 drops of my new sauce. After all, I didn't want to ruin the taste. Here is where the modern tragedy truly begins. For those of you that have ever seen SpongeBob, there is the SpongeBob movie, and in one particular scene, Spongehomie wasn't sure if he was gonna make it back to the ocean. He was near death since he was deprived of water for so long. He looked like trash and was shriveled up and damn near grey. I say all this to say that after taking that first bite, my tongue turned into this rendition of SpongeBob. Never in my life have I tasted anything so salty. I can assure you that I could have eaten a mixture of 6 lbs. of pure salt, with 20 packs of ramen noodle seasoning, crumbled up some lays classic chips, and the tears of anyone who has ever been slighted in history, and it STILL would not have been as salty as this bite. Silly me for thinking that it was only the first bite...so I took 3 more. Tears formed in my eyes (which is miraculous because I was sure that all the water in my body had gone away) and I had to stop eating. I am in college, Motosurf, I take enough Ls. Never should anyone ever have to experience this. To all Yelp readers out there, don't be me, be better than me. Do not get the Kalua pork. Your body will immediately cramp up from dehydration and it will require soaking in a shower for 36.38 hours in order to remedy the skin shrivelment that is bound to happen. Perhaps the suitcase lady gave me some bad juju, so I may have to tr",

Â During the lunch hour rush at the UW campus, you can expect intimidating long lines, but the line goes fast if you're not in an extreme hurry. Also, factor in that if you ate elsewhere, you'd have to walk much further away from the heart of campus. The combo slider was a good deal, I chose the kalua pork slide and the spam slider, and with it you get a mac salad scoop. Â $5.40 for lunch was an extremely good deal for those on a budget. Â  The down side was that the buns did not seem like they were toasted, and my food wasn't as hot as I would like it. Â I'd like to try their breakfasts, nonetheless, on my next jaunt to the UW.",

Not much to say, it's not the greatest but it will do. Korean BBQ chicken is just alright. The chicken is pretty dry as well so add some sauce. Flavor is decent, not too bold though for what I would expect from a BBQ chicken dish. $6 gets you two decent sized pieces of chicken, rice and kimchi though. Might not get this again. Everything else is simple enough that it can't be messed up. If the kalua and chicken weren't so dry I would give this place 4 stars easily though.",

I see quite a few construction workers going here too, so that's a testament to their sizing lol.- The location... when you're coming from campus and just don't wanna walk anywhere up the ave, then this place becomes really appealing. Plus there's always that nice blues/rnb singer who stands at the corner (give him tips and applaud when you can!)- I really enjoy their seafood noodle soup lol... Good flavor and is fulllll of squid, oyster, shrimp, mushrooms and veggies... really hits the spot on a rainy, cold day.THE MEH:- Â I found a piece of plastic in my noodle bowl once lol (-1 star*)... it's not that bad compared to what other friends have found in theirs..............lol I told the manager about it and he gave me 2 free meal tokens!!!!

We had the corned beef hash and french toast plates, which both come with potatoes o'brien. I had bacon that came out crisp even though I didn't ask for it (yay!) and the french toast was teeny baguette slices piled high and covered with powdered sugar. The hash looked great, too, and the eggs were cooked to order. I wished my potatoes were a little warmer than room temperature, but even that didn't ruin my meal.

    "review": "I should preface this with that i was really liking A-Pizza Mart before this review. Â I work by the one in Belltown and have had awesome service there. Â I have also ordered delivery from this specific location about 3 times before with positive experiences. Â Pizza is definitely not gourmet but for delivery or quick take-out it's fresh and decent. Â I'm still new to Seattle so I haven't tried many other pizza delivery places so this became my go-to for a busy day. Â Normally the pizza arrives really quickly -like before the estimated arrival time. Â This time it was late so I called the restaurant while also contacting GrubHub to figure out if it was on its way. Â The guy I got on the phone was asking me a question but I couldn't understand what he was saying because of the noise in the background and he had a thick accent. Â He started getting short with me because I couldn't hear his question very well and thus probably have him information he didn't ask for. Â But then the door bell rang and it was the pizza so I told him I had to go and hung up. Â When I opened the pizza box it definitely looked different from my usual A-Pizza Mart build-a-pizza order. Â I ordered pepperoni to be added but could only see the veggies I wanted. Â So I called the restaurant again and got the same guy. Â Apparently he was still upset at me for calling about the late pizza before and immediately began telling me it was delivered and giving me a lot of attitude. Â I finally asked him to please listen to my question first and then give me an answer and oh yeah...be kind. Â I calmly told him that the pizza was incorrect and then he tried to tell me that he put the pepperoni on the bottom (below the cheese...even though the veggies were in a normal pizza spot). Â He told me that this is how they make pizza with pepperoni at A-Pizza Mart. I've ordered many pizzas in my life and quite a few from A-Pizza mart specifically and have never seen this sparing amount of pepperoni below cheese to stay soggy and undercooked in my life. Â This must be a new recipe they haven't warned the public about. He also told me that if I wanted to have pepperoni on the top with all the other toppings I should have (I guess know they had this new and very unique pizza method) and told them specifically to put it on the top in the notes/instructions. Â He became increasingly hostile to me when I was confused about this weird pizza making method and told him I had never seen pizza be made like this. Â He angrily asked me \"What do you want me to do?\" and \"What are you going to do about it?\" Â He told me multiple times that he couldn't make me a new one to fix it because it was my fault and I should have known and told him. Â So I just told him to not worry about fixing it because I'll go to GrubHub (who delivered it) to handle it and get a refund. Â He responded with a \"So I'm going to get another phone call from them?\" Yup. Â  Â  Â  Â I guess it's time to find a new go-to pizza delivery spot...that makes pizza the normal way and at least try to be nice to you when you call them.",

They put up signs and remind you on the menu, so go ahead and order at the bar. Service is pretty chill and friendly. The pizza here is solid, but I would also like to point out that the wings here are pretty good, too. 10 spicy wings that are actually spicy and are pretty meaty for 7 bucks is a solid deal in my book.

First off, when we got there, they were BLASTING the music so incredibly loud that it was almost a joke (we realized that they were probably using this bizarre and rude tactic to try to get people to leave since it was close to closing time - but why not just tell people they were closing soon and they needed to get out?) Anyway, the real reason for the 1 star is because we experienced the rudest bartender on this side of the Mississippi that night. We were just patiently sitting there, losing our hearing capabilities and waiting for our take-out pizzas. Meanwhile, we were having a drink while we waited. 10 minutes in, the bartender came up to our table, took my boyfriend's half-full beer right off the table and my boyfriend was like, \"Oh, hey man, can I just chug my beer real quick?\" and the bartender said \"NOPE! We are closing soon.\" and threw it out. What the actual f*ck? My boyfriend paid for that beer, tipped well, and then the a**hole bartender didn't even have the decency to let my boyfriend drink it. We were all shocked - who does that? We must have missed his \"last call\" announcement (probably cuz we couldn't hear a damn thing in there!) and we were being respectful and not doing ANYTHING wrong. The other thing that really bothered me was that my boyfriend was the only black person in there, and I watched the bartender after this happened and he didn't do this to anyone else (including the other people at our table!) I don't want to jump to conclusions, but I'm just recalling the situation and including those details - you decide how to read it...On our way out, I talked to what seemed to be the manager and told him what happened and how downright rude it was. He apologized profusely and said that that has never happened to his knowledge before. He was nice (that's where the 1 star comes in.) It made the situation better, but still we left very bothered and upset. This happened months ago, and I still think about it once in a blue moon. It was mostly hurtful because the bartender didn't do this to anyone else, so obviously in our minds, discrimination was the only thing we could justify this behavior as. I don't know this for sure, so I will not say that he is racist or picking my boyfriend out of a crowd. It was just incredibly rude and uncalled for - left the worst taste in my mouth and we'll never return. No one should ever be treated that way, especially respectful, paying customers.On the bright side, even though our pizza took forever, it was OK.",

The service was abysmal though. I've never had to stand there and wait so long for somebody to even start making my drink. I took about 5 minutes from order before the girl even started to think about making my drink despite there being no line ahead of me, only regulars coming in after. In fact 3 bagel orders were finished from the time I ordered before I got my drink. Also immediately after I ordered my drink the prep guy asked the girl at the counter if he should make my drink to get it out of the way quickly as she was still busy making a bagel, she told him \"No, I got this\" and I had to honor of waiting another 8 minutes because she didn't want him to put down his lettuce for 30 seconds. This is what drove me nuts and made me a bit late for work because I only went in since I saw that there wasn't a line figuring it would be a quick stop. That they could have done the correct thing and expedite my order quickly but chose make me wait instead is pretty unacceptable to me. Especially considering how many years I've spent working in customer service myself. Here's a tip for your baristas: customers should come before lettuce... especially during the morning commuting hours.Also the bagels aren't made there, so I'm guessing that they're just purchased from Blazing bagels or a decent local spot and then marked up.

I have been coming to Bean and Bagel for three years while in graduate school, and the amount of staff turnover (many of whom have worked here the entire time I've been a patron) in the past few months is not only appalling, but indicative that something is terribly wrong with the way management and oversight is being conducted here. While picking up my bagel today, I noticed a security camera pointed directly down at the employees. This is a new installation, and it's VERY evident that it is being used for employee surveillance instead of security. Having worked in an environment like this for 4 years, I am not at all surprised the staff is leaving in droves.Both Cinzia and Mikayla breathed so much life into this place, and made BnB the UW Anthropology Departments chosen coffee and lunch spot. My colleagues and I were in here sometimes every day, doing work, studying, and getting to know the staff well. With the amount of staff turnover here, I doubt that same level of community will be attainable. The obvious cameras also make me less willing to stay.I feel bad for the employees honestly; we all know what it's like having someone looking over your shoulder constantly. It's not a healthy way to work, even for a couple hours, let alone the entirety of every shift. All of the old managers have left, and from what I can tell, will not be replaced. Having managed a fleet of entry-level employees myself and having dealt with facilities management and scheduling oversight, I can attest to the toxicity of micromanagement. I can attest to the fact that trusting your employees with autonomy, paying them what they are worth, and respecting their work ethic makes for loyal employees who stay for years. We don't leave jobs, we leave managers, and I'm so very sorry to see so many of BnB's friendliest and personable staff leaving theirs. I hope management realizes that BnB's long time patrons who come here for community and who have bonded with these wonderful individuals will likely leave with them.",

These are no New York bagels, but they're decent.Coffee is pretty gross, nearly undrinkable. Â I cannot speak to their espresso drinks, as I have never tried one. Â Warning: the place gets a little crazy mornings during rush hour. Â Thankfully, they turn the bagels out really fast.",

But after a turnover in staff last year, the few times I've given it a try have meant burnt bagels and/or bagels with cream cheese having a plop of cream cheese in the middle and not even remotely spread out. It also is incredibly slow now- it took 15 minutes for someone to make two bagels when the shop wasn't busy and they were just on bagel making duty. And even if you're next in line, they'll start orders for people behind you who they know before even taking your order.",

The inside is relatively spacious in the back with one or two tables considering how small it looked from the outside. There is also a little coffee stand opening at the front of the store for when it gets too packed in the store or for coffee pick up! The service was a bit iffy; the ladies there seemed a bit reserved, agitated and rushed. It left me feeling a little like the same. I decided on an Ursula, which consisted of the Everything bagel with turkey, cream cheese, marionberry, swiss and lettuce. It didn't take long at all for me to receive my breakfast bagel, which is always nice; nobody wants to talk to a hangry gal! The Ursula bagel was quite delicious! I really enjoyed the combination of the sweetness of the jam with cream cheese along with the saltiness of the turkey and cheese! I would recommend trying the Ursula above anything else if you, like me, have trouble deciding on what to eat 99% of the time. It definitely filled me up! Case of hangry syndrome successfully closed. Cheers to the weekend!",

My problem is with the little girl who on weekdays is the one toasting, spreading cream cheese, and otherwise preparing the bagels for customers. No only does she have s**t look on her face and refuses to smile, but when I say \"thank you\" and look her in the eye she replies \"yeah\". She doesn't even look up. This has happened twice now while this little stuck up girl means nothing to me, a little curtesy goes a long way with customer service. If you are the nice lady, who I assume is the owner, I recommend thinking twice about who you hire. Ever watch the show Portlandia? This place reminds me of the shop \" Women and Women First\".

I don't ask them to do my taxes or unload the dishwasher; I want to tussle on the floor and boop snoots and I want to throw things for their enjoyment. They are great dogs because they are good dogs.Likewise, when you spill out of the Monkey Pub at 1AM, all you want in the ENTIRE WORLD is for there to be a pizza place next door that will heat up a couple slices and throw them in a box for you to eat on the way home. You don't want anything particularly complicated, but you want it to fold slightly while retaining its structural integrity, and you want a satisfying but not overbearing amount of grease, and you want a generous dose of cheesy saltiness to put a perfect coda on the evening. The fact that you can have all these things precisely at the moment you want them the most is nearly miraculous. You may say I'm moving the goalposts, or damning with faint praise, but I will tell you with complete honesty that I enjoyed this pizza about as much as any I've eaten in my life. It is great because it is good. What more can you ask of pizza, of dogs, of humanity, or of yourself?",

    "review": "MOLDY FOOD!!! MANAGEMENT DID NOT CARE!! Picture attached!!Yelp needs to create a ZERO stars option specifically for this restaurant. While staying as a guest at a hotel in Seattle on August 30th, I ordered a pizza, two pasta courses, some appetizers and two tiramisu deserts for my family. After the food was delivered my son took a piece of pizza but the dough was undercooked to the point that it was inedible. I told him not to eat it, and he started eating the appetizer. Since my wife and I had already had a late dinner we just wanted the tiramisu and the rest of the order was for the kids. After opening the tiramisu and taking a large bite I was almost immediately ill and had to rush to the bathroom to vomit. After coming out of the bathroom my wife and I inspected the Tiramisu and found MOLD spores covering the entirety of the piece I had a taken a large bite out of, and several smaller MOLD spores on the second slice. We hadn't touched the pasta, and the pizza was inedible, but I took the mozzarella sticks and bread away from my kids and had my wife order them something else. I immediately called the restaurant and the woman I spoke to was very apologetic and said she would have the manager call me. The manager never did. I called the next day after they opened in the late afternoon and was once again told the manager would call. On this occasion I left my hotel room phone number in addition to my cell phone number. Again, they NEVER called. I explained to the woman that took my call that we still had all of the food and I wanted a refund because at that point, with the undercooked pizza, and the moldy tiramisu that made me physically sick, I had to consider the possibility that all of the food could be contaminated. I called again the next night, and while speaking to I believe the same woman I told her specifically, I just want a refund, you guys can pick up the food, please have the manager call me, on this occasion someone in the background said something to the effect of, \"it's just mold\". Again, the manager never called. Over the next four days I called and never received a call back. On the 7th of September, in what I suspect was an effort to get me to stop calling I had an $11.00 refund, the cost of the two tiramisu's refunded to my account. Never once, did management call me to offer so much as an apology. This is absolutely unacceptable and their passive attitude towards food safety compelled me to write this review in the hopes that no one else gets sick, or gets treated as poorly as I was.",

The ONLY good thing about this place was it was prompt and open late which I needed because I got into town late and had few choices at 1am. The other thing I will say is I KNOW late night eats are usually going to be a bit lower in quality but this was so far below that it was actually putrid. I ordered wings, a small meat lovers pizza and a tuna salad thing. The wings were clearly tossed frozen (or maybe even like warm) into its container that it was going to be delivered in and then tossed in a microwave or heater to get to temp. How do I know this? Because the wings were stuck to the bottom of the container with the classic burn marks on the bottom of the container that you get when you cook something in it without flipping. Â Think cookies in a pan in the oven or... I don't know... Wings in a pan in the oven you know how you have to scrape them off the pan with a spatula if they get burned? Yupsame principle here. On to the salad, this thing was a nightmare, I got shrimp added on to the salad cuz, you know I'm in Seattle I wanted some seafood... Dumb I know but I was in the mood. So it was canned tuna fish and these tiny shrimp things that were cold flavorless and gross. Finally this effing pizza! This was atrocious rubbery dough with 2 cent cheese and toppings that were barely cooked I took one bite and that was it. The most disgusting thing of all? This neat vomit inducing meal was almost $40. Â I mean this sincerely unless you're a college kid who's stomach is a tank and who's tastes aren't discerning this is not the place for you and. Even if you are that aforementioned college kid it's probably out of your budget anyway. You're seriously better off with McDonald's or nothing at all.",

I really like that they sell high quality pantry essentials (albeit at a great markup) and have a great beer, wine, and kombucha selection.

I still enjoy coming here now and then because the coffee is good, location is great, and it's so cute. But they should try to improve the atmosphere, mainly playing music a bit quieter, so it does not feel so suffocating in there.",

The group also ordered pork pulled, blt and a few others - you can't go wrong with anything on their menu! Everyone is extremely kind and service was quick. I highly recommend for a great experience (though someone in the group needs to be a member).",

Â The service is always fast, friendly and very cordial.The menus change every day and are very well done. Â From sandwiches, to soup and salad, to thoughtful entrÃ©es which normally feature one pasta, one seafood and one meat dish. Â The chefs are very well-trained and they also have vegetarian options and can easily accommodate any special dietary needs.The best part of the food here is where they source their ingredients. Â Most of it come from local and/or organic farms. Â The membership has also made many sustainable and wonderful suggestions to make this an even better place. Â For example, they just changed their coffee supplier from the UW \"usual\" (Tully's) to Stumptown, which is a local roaster dedicating to fair-trade, and they are good.UW Club also has probably the most secretive \"Happy Hour\" ever in the area, right on campus. Â Plus this is an event place, with the best view of Lake Washington on campus. Â One full side of the dining area has huge windows facing the lake.The only caveat may be the fact that this is a qualified membership only place, but if one qualifies and would not mind paying their dues ($160/year), this club is well worth joining.And did I forget to mention that you can get a beer at lunch?Once you are there, you wonder why any one would ever walk into the HUB and deal with those food services which were expensive and crap. Â Thank goodness that the HUB is under renovation right now, so those vendors can't quite poison the campus population.UW Club, I highly recommend it.",

I will say, I've seen the employees get stressed out and the line get really long and backed up before. However, when that happens people tend to get snappy and kind of rude pretty quickly, which obviously causes the employees to stress even more. I absolutely love Subway and have gone to some pretty terrible locations. However, all things considered, I think this location is pretty good. I have to think that maybe some people giving negative reviews about employees taking an \"attitude\" with them maybe just caught them on a bad day, or took a situation where an employee was really stressed out a bit personally.",

Goood job.Now I was in kind of a hurry at the time, so I didn't want to have it toasted. But without asking she put it in the oven and just walked away to attend someone else. Gooood job.When she finally got back to my sandwich, I asked for the vegetables and condiments I wanted and she put them on. I said that was it and moved over the the register, ready to pay. However, as she slid my sandwich over to be wrapped, she spilled a good handful of the contents (lettuce, peppers, and onions, all covered with mustard) onto the metal counter. Not the area meant for plating the subs, but the metal counter with the register. What does she do? Grabs the spilled contents and proceeds to jam them back into my sandwich. Good ****ing job.Keep in mind that now her right hand, which is gloved at least, is now completely smeared with mustard. It ends up all over the bread of my sandwich, the wrapping, inside and outside the plastic bag and its handle area, and even the napkins. Holy ****, job well done.Hey, at least she took off her gloves when she took my credit card. I didn't say anything throughout that whole ordeal, but I really should have. Honestly though, that was probably the best sandwich she'd made all day and I didn't want to see how else she could mess it up.Here's some advice from me to you: Don't go to the Subway on the ave during the lunchtime hours on Wednesdays, cause that's most likely this lady's shift.",

A red-headed bearded bouncer is rushing everyone through with an attitude and we are up next. The guy checks my ID and is telling people to move to give him elbow space and is flailing his arms around and almost elbows a dude leaving the bar. I simply said \"Cmon man\". I'm just trying to get into this bar and chill with my friends. The line to get in was already long and is now piling up way outside the door in 40 degree weather. This dude decides the best way to do his job is try to flex his ego and hold up EVERYBODY so he can tell me \"how hard his job is\". You're looking at IDs and almost elbowed a dude in the face. You almost fucked up LOOKING AT IDs. Pretty tough job I'd say. Bouncer guy then proceeds to stamp my arm and as I'm walking by he wants to flex his ego one more time by telling me \"you should learn some respect\". My last comment to this dude is \"you need to earn it\" as I'm almost in the bar. Our hero then decides to stop me completely and tell me to \"get out of his bar\". I ask him \"for what reason?\" And the dude says I have an attitude and he doesn't want me here. He runs the bar. He owns it I guess. Really great impression of an owner. This guy was already slow at checking my ID in the first place. Now he's trying to get someone else over so he can escort me out. The whole time people are cold as shit waiting in line outside the bar. I offer our genius an alternative by saying I'll wait on the side here while you check IDs. I don't want to hold up the line because of this guy. He repeatedly says \"no, you need to get out or I'll escort you out.\" At this point I didn't even care for going in anymore, but just wanted to tell the irony of the story to the person running the bar. After about a minute of him refusing my offer to wait on the side while he gets someone I just leave. The last thing I tell our ID checking savant is \"I'm not doing this for you, but I don't want to hold the line because of you.\" Ironic that a door bouncer who rushes people decides the best option is to hold everyone up while he flaunts his ego.You want to become a better bar instantly then I suggest you get rid of the egomaniac at your door.

Since most restaurants in the area are Asian in nature and we had already had Asian food, we were in the mood for something else. We needed a quick bite before class started. The ambiance was typical of an Irish Pub urban experience for college students.Glad we gave them a chance. It was a Tuesday at 5 PM and they offered $6.00 appetizers and $2.00 tacos. All of the food was very good! Coconut shrimp, mozzarella sticks, hot wings, tacos and wedge salad all hit the spot for three people with eclectic cravings. Service was very good and I would definitely return, especially during happy hour on a Tuesday! The food was truly satisfying with no question. Hot fudge brownie and ice cream was a great way to end the meal!",

This place does not give you the feeling of an Irish bar at all.The place is reasonably large, with a bar just as your enter, and a big sitting room after that. However, there isn't any evidence of they trying to decorate the bar at all. They have basic tables and chairs, and seems to be a more like a frat-frequented place. They have a karaoke stage at the end. We were a large group, and our server showed no interest in being friendly, and acted like he was there against his will. The cocktails & drinks were tasty, but felt like they cheap out on the alcohol. Other places have generous pours, but not this one.The prices aren't too bad, and they have good happy hour specials on certain days, as well as food specials late night. The food isn't great, but not bad either. Nachos were decent.I wouldn't come back except when they have drink specials. I'd rather go to other places on the ave, which have stronger drinks and a better vibe.",

If you're hesitant about what to try, go for the vegetarian caprese or ham and cheese sandwich. It will blow you away. If you're looking for a wrap, go for the chicken wrap with your choice of sauce, but I hear buffalo is recommended. Now other than the sandwiches, there are two other sections inside this place, the cafe and freshens. I haven't tried the cafe, but based on what I've seen, they often get orders jumbled up. Freshens, I have tried, and.. (here it comes) avoid it as most as possible. Taste and sanity are a complete failure. The frozen yogurt tastes powdery and artificial to the max. Furthermore, you can just tell the fruits and stuff are all very old and have been sitting and waiting for you. It has sketchy written all over it.

And it makes me realize how much I miss the HUB, because it was so much better. By George really is not much of a step up from high school cafeterias, because it's always so crowded and everything is so overpriced that there's not much about it that makes it appealing.Okay, I guess I can start with some positive notes. It's conveniently close to Odegaard Library, but it's not also open for 24 hours, so you'll have to get your food elsewhere if you're pulling an all-nighter there. This is also the place I visit occasionally to deposit money on my Husky Card, and it's also home to one of the few public microwaves that I know of on campus. The weird thing about the microwave--aside from the fact that nobody ever seems to clean it--is that you don't really input how much time you want your food to be heated for. You push a number, like 6 for instance, and it gives you something like 45 seconds for whatever reason. I still haven't been able to figure it out.There is a Subway here, but I've never found them quite as good as the one on the Ave. Next to that is a bunch of extremely overpriced pastries. There are also burgers for sale here; they carry ridiculous prices as well. I bought and have a picture of a \"Husky Burger\" here. I can't figure out what's so special about it that it has its name or its price. It was $3.50 back in spring 2011 and is $4.00 now. It's not particularly big, either. Final thing to note here is the smoothies. I got a 32 oz drink here for $6.12 once, and while it was very good, it made me sad how the University can ask for so much money after charging us so much for tuition. I hope inflation has more to do with it than anything else.Bottom line is that you can and should get your food from somewhere else. I've found By George to be a nice place to eat lunch on some of the colder days, but when it's nice out, there's really no reason to be holed up in such an unpleasant place. The Ave is not much farther away and they generally don't seem to have a problem with keeping prices down. Their quality is another matter entirely, but that's beside the point. If you do happen to be staying overnight at Odegaard, do remember to have a plan about food in advance, because you're not going to like it when you get hungry while burning the midnight oil and even this place isn't open to you.",

However, most if not all of the original employees still manage the restaurant. The tables, menu, and restaurant environment have not changed in the slightest bit; the menu still has the original restaurant name on it. However, they do offer happy hour ($1 off certain dishes from 4-6pm), but I'm not sure if that has been an ongoing tradition or not.I ordered a 5 Star Pad Thai with chicken for $9.90 (including tax, but not tip). The noodles were flavorful and had a good peanut taste to them, but it was almost like they forgot to put the chili into it. I saw a few chili flakes, but for a 5-Star dish, my mouth should've been on fire. I was disappointed and can't imagine how bland a 1-Star Pad Thai must be. There was also very little chicken in my dish, and the only veggies on my plate were some raw Â shredded cabbage, bean sprouts, and carrots.

The pizza is always good, but I would recommend trying a calzone. They are large, but leftovers aren't a bad thing. Finally the worst service is definitely in the Broiler Zone. I love the mushroom brugers, but the last 3 times I ordered one, I ended up with a black bean burger, which are much more mushy. Also, if you order fries as a side as opposed to as a combo, you get a significantly smaller basket of fries. I once even had a cashier tell me I couldn't add sauce or cheese to my mushroom burger, which was not true at all. She was just too lazy to type it in.

It's mostly soups and salads, with a few premade sandwiches and desserts in a refrigerated case i think (probably the same stuff that they have at the Etc). They have a good variety of soups generally 5-6 each day. So far I've had the chicken noodle, the corn chowder, the potato, and the split pea with ham. Everything has been good (chicken noodle wasn't my fav). And getting the bread bowl w/ soup is super economical. It's five bucks, and just that by itself is very filling. I have a pretty limited salad range, being that I like Caesar salad ... and nothing else really. But they have a nice little salad mixing station, where they can make you a fresh tossed caesar salad, you don't have to put any of the ingredients together or anything. It's five bucks, and pretty big. and an extra buck gets you chicken, though I haven't gone for the chicken yet cause I think cold chicken in salads is kinda ewey. It would be nice if they had a smaller option for like, $2.50 or so, so that you could do a large soup/bread bowl with soup and a small salad for under 8 bucks. I mentioned it a couple times, but oh well. Be warned, get there later in the day and they might be out of bread bowls.For the variety of options that the hub has, most of what I have tried there has been pretty bad (pasta place, asian firecracker or whatever its called).

For now, it's in a temporary trailer thing, along with a taco not-truck called Siganos. But apparently they're getting a truck, joining Hot Dawgs and the soon-to-be-opened Motosurf (Hawaiian plates).So, a University-run BBQ place. Sounds like a recipe for disaster. Microwaved meat covered in oversweetened pseudo-Kansas-style sauce, anyone?Surprisingly, Red Brick is actually pretty decent. The menu is simple -- pulled pork, sliced brisket, pulled chicken (all $6.95 for sandwiches or $2.50 for sliders) and hot link sandwiches ($4.95). A couple of sides -- baked beans, slaw, potato salad.On my first visit, I went with the brisket and baked beans. The meat came piled on a kaiser roll. Smaller portion than you'd have gotten for a similar price at an actual BBQ place, but reasonable value for money on a college campus. The meat was juicy and tender, good flavor. No smoke rings, if you care about that sort of thing. I got the spicy sauce; seemed to be tomato-and-vinegar based. The beans were a little unusual -- soupy, strongly onion-flavored, moderately sweet. I liked them.On my second visit, I got the pork, with slaw on the sandwich. Not as well-put-together as the brisket. The flavor was non-specific, and the meat had several squishy fatty bits.On the whole, nothing mind boggling. But this is better BBQ than I'd have expected on a college campus. Given that the nearest BBQ place I know of is RoRo in Wallingford, this is a very welcome addition to the U District.Oh, for now, they are card only.

(yes, word for word this was what she said.)- The server did not go to the back to ask the chef about this so I just left because I'd rather NOT DIE because some lazy server did not want to spend a measly 30 seconds to find out if the food was seafood-free or not.- I wrote to HFS (Housing & Food Services ) to complain, because being anaphylactic to certain foods, I really don't want to drop dead because of situations like this, and this is just one less restaurant I can trust. I did not get a reply from HFS. Poop on HFS and the lazy, lazy, lazy server with horrid customer service at Firecracker.",

Whenever I go, I always order a Rosa Chipotle with roasted veggies pasta which comes either with a chewy sourdough baguette or a soft breadstick. The only reason why I think some people would think that the pasta isn't so great is because they give a heavy portion of food which might make you sick trying to finish it. So, do your own portion control.On the other hand, the sandwiches are a hit or a miss. Orin's is constantly exploring and experimenting with their daily sandwiches and wraps. However, this isn't completely a bad thing. Sometimes, the sandwiches or wraps that they make will just blow you away. Orin's is worth checking out. Actually, Paccar Hall in general.

Sure, you could make pasta on your own, but something about Orin's place is just really good.So you get the piece of paper and you fill it out. Choose your sauce: you can get marinara, alfredo, or rosa. Rosa is a mix between red and white sauce.Then you can pick accents: basil-pesto, sun dried tomatoes, and there's one more that I can't quite remember. But why would you pick that when you can choose basil-pesto! Just kidding, but there really is one more.Then you can decide if you want to add vegetables and chicken. However, I haven't heard the best things when you add those in there. I hear it's just good by itself.Then you either check the To-Go box or you don't, depending on whether you want your pasta in a compostable box or a plate. I usually like to go with the box because it makes the pasta bunch up together and it's easier to just stab at it with your fork.Then you take the bottom part (which is your receipt, sort of), and you turn in the top part to the little tray. Then the chefs will take it, and start your food. Meanwhile, you take that bottom part, which is just a carbon copy, and you turn it into the cashier and pay for your food. They take card, cash and husky card (if you are dorming and have a meal plan). Pasta is about $6.50 each, which is actually pretty cheap for pasta and for campus food in general. Win-win situation there for people who dorm and for people who don't.They will call your name when your pasta is done. Then you grab it and go eat. I would avoid coming to Paccar at every :30 increments since that is when class gets out and people will rush in to get food. However, you can eat anywhere in Paccar or take it to go and go somewhere else.My boyfriend and I always get the same thing here. Rosa with basil pesto. It's the best combination ever and tastes divine. It comes topped with Parmesian cheese and a breadstick. The breadstick isn't super wonderful, but it's nice to just have as a side. But the pasta, that's something to really rave about. The sauce is just so good because you have both red and white sauce, and the basil pesto adds that nice herb kick to it. In the end, it's the only place to really get pasta on campus. Well, there's also the pasta place that on the bottom floor of the HUB, but I still think Orin's place is better in regards to pasta.",

Anyway, in terms of the food, I try to steer clear of the salads and sandwiches, mostly because I have class in the evening and everything has been picked over. I've tried sandwiches that were left and they were pretty gross.The only redeeming quality is the pasta bar. It's not the greatest but surprisingly good considering how crappy the rest of the options are. But it is SLOW and pricey.

No one needs to spend $4.95 for a half a piece of pita bread and 2 tbsp of basic hummus.R (Things Orin's should RAISE):- Healthy, quick food offerings. I love that Orin's has grab-and-go options like yogurt with granola, fruit salad, pre-made deli sandwiches and pre-made salads. I especially like the thai chicken wrap with peanut sauce. - Caffeinated drinks. Lord knows that business school students need all the help they can get staying awake on 14-hour class days. The drip coffee and espresso bar using Starbucks brand products are great, and the more variety the better.- Seating. Orin's is popular enough that there's almost never a free table available during peak hours.- Composting, hurrah. They do a great job of using 95% biodegradable products and materials.C (Things Orin's should CREATE):- Self-service honor system drip coffee during peak hours. Coffee costs so little to make, and they would generate a lot of profit by capturing all the demand from customers who see the long lines and run away during busy times.",

Moving into my experience today. The pizza by the slice option was very enticing. They had 4 flavor to choose from: cheese, pepperoni, combo, and chicken pesto. Slices range in price depending on pizza, but all hover around $3. I ended up going with a calzone because none of the pizza flavors jumped out at me. The calzones here start at $7 for a basic marinara, ricotta, and mozzarella. Add-ins cost a dollar each. I added Italian sausage and sun-dried tomatoes. The calzone took 15 minutes to make and when it was done, a worker brought it out to where I was sitting. The calzone didn't look huge, but half way through I realize just how stuffed it was with filling. Cheese oozed everywhere as I ate it, so satisfying!! They give you a bit of marinara to dip the calzone in, but I ran out. I will be sure to ask for 2 marinaras next time!",

Â It was perfect! Â Not too spicy but tolerable. Â Highly recommended!!",

    "review": "Pi day - this establishment doesn't sell 11\" pizzas unless they are gluten free. Keep this in mind if you are trying to take advantage of the Pi Day buy one get one 11\" pizza for $3.14 promotion, as I ended up paying full price. They didn't believe me when I told them about the company's own promotion, and I had to pull out my phone browser to prove myself. This came off to me as patronizing and very unprofessional.UPDATE: The pizza is cold in the center. At least it is edible? :(",

Â I honestly would prefer a better tasting beef patty.",

You need to tell them to use new gloves, because they don't notice these things if you have allergies or are a strict vegan/veggie.They had the price for a vegan sandwich about $1 less than a vegetarian sandwich and then charged me for a vegetarian sandwich when I ordered a vegan sandwich. After I pointed that out, they said that the price on the menu board was incorrect and refused to charge me the price that was listed on the board. $1 is not much but I go to school f/t and don't work - every dollar counts.Sucks overall.",
